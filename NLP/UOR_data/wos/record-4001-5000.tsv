This defect engineering strategy is realized by a facile urea oxidation method in nitrogen atmosphere. Through X-ray diffraction (XRD) refinement and other detailed characterizations, molybdenum ion (Mo4+) is found to be doped into Co3O4 by substituting cobalt ion (Co2+) at tetrahedron site, while N is doped into carbon matrix simultaneously. 4%Mo-Co3O4/NC is the optimized sample to show the lowest overpotentials of 91 and 276 mV to deliver 10 mA cm-2 for HER and OER in 1 M potassium hydroxide solution (KOH), respectively. The overall water splitting cell 4%Mo-Co3O4/NC parallel to 4%Mo-Co3O4/NC displays a voltage of 1.62 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The Mo4+ dopant modulates the electronic structure of active cobalt ion (Co3+) and boosts the water dissociation process during HER, while the increased amount of lattice oxygen and formation of pyridinic nitrogen due to Mo doping benefits the OER activity. Besides, the smaller grain size owing to Mo doping leads to higher electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) on 4%Mo-Co3O4/NC, resulting in its superior bifunctional catalytic activity.

During the heat challenge period, the goats exhibited significantly higher skin temperatures, pulse rates and respiration rates than during the control period. The rumen pH and concentrations of ammonia-N (NH3-N), total volatile fatty acids (TVFAs), acetic acid and propionic acid were significantly lower during the heat challenge period than during the control period. In addition, the butyric acid concentration, acetate "to-propionate ratio (A/P ratio) and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) in the rumen were significantly increased in heat-challenged goats compared to those in control period. During the heat challenge period, the goats showed significantly higher serum creatine kinase (CK) activity and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and malonaldehyde (MDA) concentrations than during the control period, while the glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity and the serum total protein (TP) and vitamins C and E concentrations were significantly lower (P < 0.05) during the control period. During the heat challenge period, the goats exhibited significantly lower (P < 0.05) dry matter (DM) intake (DMI) and average daily gain (ADG) than during the control period and significantly higher (P < 0.05) digestibilities of DM, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) than during the control period. These results suggest that the effect of a heat challenge on goats is systemic. Therefore, in goat production practices, the adverse effects of heat stress should not be ignored.

Ferulic acid (FA), a phenolic acid widely found in plants, has multiple pharmacological effects such as anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation and anti-tumor. However, the current research on FA in the field of DN is insufficient. The present study aimed to explore the nephroprotective effect of FA on DN in mice and reveal its underlying mechanism. DN was induced by high-fat diet (HFD) combined with streptozotocin (STZ) injection in male C57BL/6J mice. Animals were randomly divided into four groups (n = 8): Control group, DN group, FA group (200 mg/kg FA, i.g.) and valsartan (VAL) group (12 mg/kg VAL, i.g.). The drug was administered once a day for 8 weeks. Treated with FA, the body weight and fasting blood glucose (FBG) of DN mice were reduced and the renal organ coefficient was significantly optimized. Meanwhile, FA decreased levels of 24-h urine protein excretion (24-h UP) in urine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr) in serum, reduced levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in serum. In addition, FA promoted light chain 3 (LC3) expression markedly, and inhibited the expressions of p62, NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in renal tissues. In conclusion, FA played a positive role in alleviating renal injury in HFD/STZ-induced DN mice by enhancing autophagy and suppressing excessive inflammation.																			0753-3322	1950-6007				SEP	2022	153								113424	10.1016/j.biopha.2022.113424	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2022.113424		JUL 2022						36076545					WOS:000855037700004

Carbon compositing, pore engineering, and nanostructure construction have proved to be effective strategies to prepare high-performance metal nitride anodes for LIBs. Herein, we synthesized a series of Fe3N-embedded and N-doped carbon nanorods (Fe3N@NCNR) with a hierarchical porous system and controllable topography by metal-catalyzed graphitization-nitridization of the Fe(III)-triazole framework (Fe-MOF) and thermal evaporation of the triblock copolymer F127 template assembled in Fe-MOF via hydrogen bonding interaction, followed by the air oxidation and urea-assisted ammonolysis processes. The Fe3N@NCNR as anodes for LIBs display extraordinary lithium storage capabilities with a high reversible capacity of 830 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C, a good rate performance of 576 mAh g-1 at 5 C, and a long-term cycling stability of 742 mA h g-1 over 600 cycles at 1 C. Such outstanding performance benefits from the spongy carbon nanorods with rich macropores for rapid electronic/ionic transport and effective accommodation of electrode volume expansion, abundant N-doped meso-/microporous carbon for the additional storage of Li+ via capacitive effect, and the efficient utilization of Fe3N nanoparticles uniformly distributed through carbon nanorods. Importantly, this work introduces an effective strategy to construct superior performance nitride anodes from MOF surfactants based on hydrogen bonding-driven interface self-assembly and provides insight into the preparation of highly efficient nanoarchitectures for Li+ storage.

Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion (NEsLP) reduces reperfusion injury of donation after circulatory death (DCD) grafts and optimizes graft function. The goal of our study was to elucidate how NEsLP impacts global metabolism in DCD grafts using high-throughput metabolomics. Methods. Pig livers were preserved by 2 different techniques: static cold storage and NEsLP. Grafts obtained from heart-beating donors were compared with donation after circulatory death (DCD) grafts with either 30 minutes (DCD30) or 60 minutes (DCD60) ischemia time. Liver tissues were collected at the end of preservation period (T0) with either cold storage or NEsLP (n = 5 per group). Grafts were transplanted into recipient pigs and a second liver biopsy was collected 2 hours following liver transplantation (T1). Snap-frozen tissue was processed and analyzed by Sciex 6600 Q-TOF high-resolution mass spectrometer. Data analysis was performed using MetaboAnalyst 4.0 software. Results. Prolonged ischemia resulted in 38 out of 81 metabolites being differentially abundant over time. Mitochondrial metabolism was significantly affected, with disruption in oxidative phosphorylation capacity i.e the Warburg effect (P = 3.62E-03) and urea cycle (P = 7.95E-0.4). NEsLP resulted in improved mitochondrial metabolism and glycolysis (4.20E-02) oxidation of branched chain fatty acids (P = 4.07E-02). Conclusions. This unbiased, high-throughput metabolomics study reveals that mitochondrial function is globally rescued with NEsLP, associated with improvement in DCD graft function. NEsLP is able to rescue DCD grafts, improving their metabolic function to that of livers not exposed to DCD procurement.

Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles Attenuate Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in the Liver of Diethylnitrosamine-Treated Mice	BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH												The catalytic activity of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2NPs) is responsible for its application as an antitumor agent. This activity may be due to its ability to switch between III and IV oxidation states thereby conferring pro- and antioxidant properties. This study was designed to assess the hepatoprotective potential of CeO2NPs in male BALB/c mice administered diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Thirty-six mice were divided equally into six groups and treated intraperitoneally with normal saline (control), DEN (200 mg/kg) alone, CeO2NPs 1 (100 mu g/kg) + DEN (200 mg/kg), CeO2NPs 2 (200 mu g/kg) + DEN (200 mg/kg), CeO2NPs 1 alone, and CeO2NPs 2 alone. Animals were pretreated with CeO2NPs daily for eight consecutive days, while DEN was administered 48 h before the animals were sacrificed. Administration of DEN caused a significant increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and urea by 51% and 96%, respectively. Markers of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde) and inflammation (nitric oxide and myeloperoxidase) in hepatic tissues of DEN-treated mice were increased by 60%, 16%, and 38%, respectively. The activities of hepatic superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, and level of reduced glutathione were significantly decreased in DEN-treated mice by 50%, 123%, 23%, 419%, and 78%, respectively. In addition, DEN increased the expression of hepatic Bcl(2) and COX-2, while p53, Bax, and iNOS were mildly expressed. Pretreatment with CeO2NPs attenuated the activities of antioxidant enzymes and expression of Bcl(2) and COX-2. Overall, CeO2NPs confers protection from DEN-induced liver damage via antioxidative activity.

Possible curative role of curcumin and silymarin against nephrotoxicity induced by gamma-rays in rats	EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY												Curcumin (CUR) and silymarin (SLM) are powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds with beneficial protective effects against renal diseases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of CUR and SLM alone or in combination on radiation (IR) induced kidney injury. The results showed that CUR and SLM alone or in combination attenuated the oxidative stress denoted by a reduction in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) along with a marked increase of glutathione GSH content and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Additionally, a significant decrease in the level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, Cystatin-C (CYT-C), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (N-GAL) and Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (Kim-1) was recorded. Moreover, the treatment resulted in a remarkable decline in the serum levels of interleukin-18(IL-18), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), C reactive protein (CRP), BCL2 associated X protein (Bax), Factor-related Apoptosis (FAS) and the activity of Caspase-3 associated by an increase of B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bc12) level. The results were confirmed with the histopathological examination. Kidney of irradiated showed glomerular atrophy, massive necrotic changes of expanded tubules with hyaline cast inside some tubules and apoptotic changes were recorded in some renal tubules. While irradiated rats treated with CUR and SLM exhibited marked preservation of the cellular structure of their kidney tissue. In conclusion, the combination of CUR and SLM could be more potent than a single agent on the biochemical and histological changes of the irradiated rat renal tissue.																			0014-4800	1096-0945				DEC	2019	111								104299	10.1016/j.yexmp.2019.104299	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexmp.2019.104299								31442446					WOS:000499762900003

Coagonist of glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucagon receptors ameliorates kidney injury in murine models of obesity and diabetes mellitus	WORLD JOURNAL OF DIABETES												AIM To investigate the role of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)/glucagon receptors coagonist on renal dysfunction associated with diabetes and obesity. METHODS Chronic high-fat diet fed C57BL/6J mice, streptozotocin-treated high-fat diet fed C57BL/6J mice and diabetic C57BLKS/J db/db mice were used as models of diabetes-induced renal dysfunction. The streptozotocintreated high-fat diet fed mice and db/db mice were treated with the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors coagonist (Aib2 C24 Chimera2, 150 mu g/kg, sc) for twelve weeks, while in chronic high-fat diet fed mice, coagonist (Aib2 C24 Chimera2, 150 mu g/kg, sc) treatment was continued for forty weeks. Kidney function, histology, fibrosis, inflammation, and plasma biochemistry were assessed at the end of the treatment. RESULTS Coagonist treatment decreased body weight, plasma lipids, insulin resistance, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urinary albumin excretion rate and renal lipids. In kidney, expression of lipogenic genes (SREBP-1C, FAS, and SCD-1) was decreased, and expression of genes involved in beta-oxidation (CPT-1 and PPAR-alpha) was increased due to coagonist treatment. In plasma, coagonist treatment increased adiponectin and FGF21 and decreased IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Coagonist treatment reduced expression of inflammatory (TNF-alpha, MCP-1, and MMP-9) and pro-fibrotic (TGF-beta, COL1A1, and alpha-SMA) genes and also improved histological derangement in renal tissue. CONCLUSION Coagonist of GLP-1 and glucagon receptors alleviated diabetes and obesity-induced renal dysfunction by reducing glucose intolerance, obesity, and hyperlipidemia.

Effect of silver nanoparticles on the immune, redox, and lipid status of chicken blood	CZECH JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												The aim of the study was to analyze how per os application of hydrocolloids of silver nanoparticles (22 nm) and lipid-coated silver nanoparticles (5 nm) affect the immune, redox, and lipid status of the blood of broiler chickens. The experiment was conducted on 60 chickens. The first group was the control (Group C). The chickens in Group II received a silver nanoparticle hydrocolloid (Ag-nano) at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight (BW) per day. The chickens in Group III received a lipid-coated silver nanoparticle hydrocolloid (AgL-nano) at a dose of 5 mg/kg BW per day. Blood for analysis was collected from 24- and 38-day-old chickens and several blood parameters were determined. The increase in phagocytosis and in the metabolic activity of leukocytes observed following per os administration of chemically synthesized silver nanoparticles differing in size and in the presence or absence of a lipid coating may indicate a developing inflammatory state in the organism. The decrease in haemoglobin content and antioxidant enzyme activity and the increase in the content of iron, bilirubin, and lipid peroxidation products are indicative of oxidative stress, although in the case of administration of AgL-nano the oxidation effect appears to be greater. Administration of silver nanoparticles to the chickens, particularly 5 nm lipid-coated nanoparticles, probably led to a disturbance in protein catabolism in the organism, which is evidenced by the decrease in the activity of the liver enzymes AST and ALT and the decreased concentration of the main protein metabolism products (creatinine and urea).

The study aimed to explore the protective effect of PL on ischemia reperfusion injury (I/R) in rat kidney. METHODS. 24 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 to 250 mg) were randomly allocated to four groups (n = 6/group): Group I: sham control, Group II: (I/R) renal ischemia/reperfusion kidney renal blocked for 1hour using clamps, followed by 2hr reperfusion. Group III: PL (25 mu g/kg) + I/R group and Group IV: PL (50 mu g/kg) + I/R group. Rat kidneys were exposed to 60 min of two-sided deep ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion. PL (25 and 50 mu g/kg bw) was administered intraperitoneally half an hour before the ischemia. Creatinine, urea, and few renal markers activity in serum were assessed. Oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were also evaluated. In addition, the expressions of COX-2 and eNOS in animal kidneys were tested by western blotting. RESULTS. Pre-treatment with PL in ischemia-reperfused rats significantly reduced the pathological damage in the kidney and declined the levels of serum creatinine and other renal parameters. PL treatment diminished the serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta, as well as messenger RNA expressions. Important biological defence parameters such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels were upregulated while malondialdehyde levels were down-regulated in PL ischemia rats. CONCLUSION. PL exhibits a protective effect against inflammation and oxidation in ischemia reperfusion animals (Fig. 5, Ref. 32).																			0006-9248	1336-0345					2022	123	12					878	884		10.4149/BLL_2022_140	http://dx.doi.org/10.4149/BLL_2022_140								36342874					WOS:001195297800004
J	Sarkar, S; Kim, B				Sarkar, Sourav; Kim, Byungki			Analysis of graphene-encapsulated polymer microcapsules with superior thermal and storage stability behavior	POLYMER DEGRADATION AND STABILITY												A new series of urea-formaldehyde polymer microcapsules with two-component cores have been synthesized by an in-situ polymerization procedure. Graphene was used as one of the components in the core material along with a bisphenol-A epoxy resin. Preparation of graphene oxide was carried out by the Staudenmaier oxidation process, followed by further thermal treatment in a controlled environment to produce thermally treated graphene (TTG). The thermal and physical properties of the microcapsules were investigated by TGA (Thermogravimetric analysis) and, SEM (Scanning electron microscopy) among other methods. The chemical composition of the microcapsules was ascertained by FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared) spectroscopy. The resultant graphene-encapsulated microcapsules have shown an increasing degree of thermal stability in the range from 250 degrees C to over 400 degrees C, depending on the TTG wt%. They also exhibited good storage stability (>90%) over different periods of time. It was determined that the thermal and physical properties of the microcapsules are closely linked to the core materials and the processing conditions. The processing conditions, in turn, can be varied to synthesize different types of microcapsules with different sizes, thermal stability and yield percentage values. The improved sway over the thermal degradation provided better control over the release rate of the core material under various conditions. Also, the unusually high thermal stability behavior of the polymer microcapsules' shell wall demonstrates better survivability of these microcapsules under harsh external conditions which can be exploited in their use as highly stable self-healing agent carrier in high-performance polymer materials.

Hibiscus sabdariffa L. (Malvaceae) calyx is commonly used in traditional Asian and African medicines and possesses strong antioxidant capacity due to its anthocyanin (ANTH) content. Objective: This study researched the possible protective role of Hibiscus sabdariffa calyx extract (HSCE) in UVC exposure of rats. Material and methods: Levels of serum enzymes, renal function tests, and some oxidant/antioxidant biomarkers of skin, lens, and retina tissues were monitored. Rats were exposed to UVC 4 h daily for 40 d and simultaneously received HSCE containing 2.5, 5, and 10 mg doses of ANTH in drinking water. Results: Significant (p < 0.05) increases in the levels of serum aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase, urea, creatinine, and uric acid were noted after UVC exposure. In skin, lens, and retina tissues, total oxidant status, oxidative stress index, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation escalated markedly (p < 0.05) whereas total antioxidant status, reduced glutathione, and superoxide dismutase decreased dramatically (p < 0.05) related to UVC. Co-administration of HSCE with each ANTH dose significantly (p < 0.05) reversed aforementioned parameters (except total oxidant status) almost in all tissues. The LD50 of HSCE in rats was determined to be above 5000 mg/kg. Discussion and conclusion: Our data revealed that HSCE has a remarkable potential to counteract UVC-caused impairments, probably through its antioxidant and free radical-defusing effects. Therefore, HSCE could be useful against some cutaneous and ocular diseases in which UV and oxidative stress have a role in the etiopathogenesis.

Forensic metabolomics: Tracing cyanide-induced metabolic changes in fatalities	FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL												Accurate detection of cyanide exposure is crucial, particularly in forensic science. However, cyanide's high volatility and potential biochemical conversions in biological samples pose challenges for direct detection, complicating the determination of cause of death. Identifying alternative cyanide metabolites as markers may mitigate false negatives and positives, extending the detection window in poisoning cases. This study aimed to evaluate metabolic changes induced by cyanide exposure in forensic cases using a multi-platform approach, including metabolomics and lipidomics analyses via liquid and gas chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Results demonstrated clear discrimination between cyanide-exposed and control groups through OPLS-DA models. A total of 92 altered metabolites were identified in cyanide-exposed individuals compared to controls. Significant changes in metabolites primarily included glycerophospholipids (30.7 %), glycerolipids (14 %), fatty acyls (12.9 %), sphingolipids (8.0 %), amino acids and analogs (8.0 %), among others. Cyanide intoxication disrupted multiple metabolic pathways, including mitochondrial beta-oxidation, acylcarnitine accumulation, a shift towards gluconeogenesis in amino acid metabolism, and ammonia homeostasis disturbance, affecting both ammonia recycling and the urea cycle. These pathways are essential for cellular energy production. The altered metabolic profiles provide insight into cyanide poisoning pathways, potentially aiding the development of new forensic diagnostic strategies. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess each model's predictive value. Findings suggest that metabolites such as phosphate and 3-hydroxybutyric acid could serve as diagnostic biomarkers in lethal cyanide poisoning cases. Future studies must evaluate these potential biomarkers' effectiveness in different fatal victim cohorts and validate the suggested panel through a targeted approach.

Osmoregulation and electrolyte balance in a fully marine mammal, the dugong (Dugong dugon)	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												Dugongs (Dugong dugon) are fully marine mammals that live independently of fresh water so must balance water and electrolytes in a hyperosmotic environment. To investigate osmoregulation, matched plasma and urine from 51 live wild dugongs were analysed for osmolality, major electrolytes (Na+, Cl-, K+), urea, creatinine, and glucose. Maximum urine osmolality (1468 mOsm kg(-1)) and Na+, K+, and Cl- concentrations (757, 131.3, 677 mmol L-1, respectively) indicate that dugongs are capable of concentrating urine above seawater and could potentially realise a net gain of free water from drinking seawater. However, mean urine osmolality of 925.4 (+/- 46.6) mOsm kg(-1) suggests that mariposia is unlikely to be an important osmoregulatory mechanism. Dugongs may obtain enough preformed water from their seagrass diet and metabolic oxidation to maintain homeostasis. Mean plasma osmolality of 339.6 (+/- 1.8) mOsm kg(-1) is higher than in the related manatees but within the range for fully marine cetaceans. Relatively high mean plasma Na+ (175.5 +/- 1.7 mmol L-1) and K+ (6.9 +/- 0.1 mmol L-1), as well as mean urinary Na+ (469.6 +/- 22.5 mmol L-1) and K+ levels (32.5 +/- 4.5 mmol L-1) may reflect a salt-rich seagrass diet. Pregnant females had higher mean plasma osmolality (355.3 +/- 4.9 mmol L-1) than non-pregnant females and males (337.9 +/- 1.7 mOsm kg(-1)), suggesting that fluid retention was not a feature of pregnancy. Further research on water intake and endocrinology will enhance our understanding of osmoregulation in dugongs.

Material and method: Adult mice were intraperitoneally treated for seven days with four graded doses of MB, corresponding to 1/8, 1/6, 1/4 and 1/2 of its lethal dose (LD50=1500mg/kg body weight). Results: Hematological analysis revealed a significant disruption in total white blood cells and platelets and a significant decrease in the plasmatic levels of ferrozine in mice treated with 1/8, 1/6 and 1/4 of MB LD50. However, the ferrozine levels increased significantly in the group treated with 1/2 of MB LD50. Evenly, our results showed a significant increase in the levels of malondialdehyde, lipid hydroperoxides, hydrogen peroxide and advanced oxidation protein products in all treated groups. The activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase decreased significantly in all MB treated mice. Additionally, all treated groups exhibited strong nephrotoxicity signs, including increases in plasma urea, creatinine and albumin levels and lactate dehydrogenase activity, as well as a significant decrease in uric acid levels. Electrophoresis analysis revealed nucleic acid degradation, testifying the genotoxicity of MB. Moreover, the histopathological observations showed severe renal injuries, which could be related to the above mentioned data. Conclusions: Our data showed, for the first time, that the MB tested doses led to oxidative stress installation causing renal cell damages and lowering all defense systems capacities.					magne, christian/AAD-6357-2021	Droguet, Mickael/0000-0002-5408-8859													1537-6516	1537-6524				JUN	2017	27	5					382	393		10.1080/15376516.2017.1300617	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15376516.2017.1300617								28322069					WOS:000399532500008

J.			pH-dependent contribution of chlorine monoxide radicals and byproducts formation during UV/chlorine treatment on clothianidin	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												Combining UV and free chlorine (UV/chlorine) is an efficient advanced oxidation process for the abatement of recalcitrant organic compounds in drinking water and wastewater. This study investigated the degradation of a neonicotinoid insecticide, clothianidin (CTD), by UV/chlorine treatment. The free chlorine concentration was optimized at 160 mu M, and 90.1 +/- 0.4% of 40 mu M CTD was degraded after 300 s of treatment. Radical quenching tests using tert-butyl alcohol, Cl-, HCO3-, and N3- indicated that chlorine monoxide (ClO center dot) was the main radical species for CTD degradation. The second-order rate constants of CTD reacting with ClO center dot (kClO center dot,CTD = 7.3 +/- 0.1 x 109 M- 1s- 1) was 4.3 times higher than that for center dot OH (k center dot OH,CTD = 1.7 +/- 0.2 x 109 M- 1s- 1). The presence of humic acid inhibited CTD degradation by filtering UV and scavenging ClO center dot. The pH was optimized at 7, and the overall reaction rate constant (k ') was 2.35 +/- 0.02 x 10-2 s- 1 (half-life = 0.49 min). Degradation products identified during the UV/chlorine treatment were 1-methyl-3-nitroguanidine ([M + H]+ = 118.9), nitroguanidine ([M + H]+ = 105.1), methylguanidine ([M + H]+ = 74.3), and clothianidin urea ([M + H]+ = 206). The detailed timedependent concentrations of the generated products under different pH conditions were also provided. The results suggest that the UV/chlorine treatment can be an efficient strategy for CTD degradation.

The AC was then modified to be nitrogen- and oxygen-enriched ACs by integration with urea, air oxidation, and KOH activation. At 25 degrees C, the nitrogen-enriched sample showed the highest CO2 adsorption affinity (uptake in pore at low pressures) and capacity (uptake in pore at moderate pressures, i.e., 1 bar). Whereas even at 0 degrees C, it still gave the highest affinity, but its capacity was reduced to be slightly lower than other samples. Consequently, a Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation was performed to macroscopically and microscopically investigate the CO2 adsorption behavior occurring in the experiments. The graphitic slit pore, in the pore width range of 0.7-1.5 nm, without a surface functional group (SFG), with pyridine (N-6), and with hydroxyl (OH) functional groups were modeled. (1) Adsorption affinity: the active site of SFG is dominant where CO2 molecules have the strongest interaction with N-functional group for all studied temperatures. The simulated results are consistent with the experimental data. (2) Adsorption capacity: the effect of pore width is more relevant. A sample with a more effective pore size gives higher capacity. However, the effective pore widths oscillated with temperature. High capacity at a suitable pore width resulted from the balance between the energy of motion and the packing of adsorbed molecules in order to optimize the energy. The energy of motion is more distinctive at high temperature; whereas, the commensurate packing is essential at low temperature.

For this purpose, polyaniline-polypyrrole-poly(sodium-4-styrenesulfonate) film was prepared by electropolymerization of aniline and pyrrole with poly(sodium-4-styrenesulfonate) on a platinum plate. The best working conditions of the polyaniline-polypyrrole-poly(sodium-4-styrenesulfonate) film were determined. The glucose oxidase enzyme was immobilized by the entrapment method in polyaniline-polypyrrole-poly(sodium-4-styrenesulfonate) film. Glucose determination was made based on the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide, which is formed as a result of the enzymatic reaction on the surface of the prepared biosensor at +0.40 V. The working range for the glucose determination of the biosensor was determined. The effects of pH and temperature on the response of the glucose biosensor were investigated. The reusability and shelf life of the biosensor were determined. The effects of interference in biological environments on the response of the biosensor were investigated. Glucose determination was made in the biological fluid (blood) with the prepared biosensor. This study has a feature that sheds light on biosensor studies to be developed for the detection of substances in the human body, such as glucose, uric acid, and urea. This article will set an example for future scientific research on the development of a sensor for other biological fluids in the human body, such as the sensor developed for blood samples. In addition, this developed sensor provides an innovation that improves the quality of life of patients by allowing them to constantly monitor their glucose levels and intervene when necessary.

Here, we have considered room-temperature and molten salt-based 16 IL-based electrolytes, consisting of imidazolium-, pyrrolidinium-, urea-, and acetamide-based cations coupled with AlCl4 and OTf (trifluoromethanesulfonate) anions. Three different high-throughput computational screening techniques have been implemented to calculate the ECW of these electrolytes for dual-ion batteries (DIBs). The thermodynamic cycle method has been employed to calculate the oxidation and reduction potentials with respect to the Al3+/Al reference electrode for the individual ions of the IL. Classical molecular dynamics followed by DFT methods (MD + DFT) have been considered to calculate anodic and cathodic limiting potentials. From the MD + DFT, we have classified two methods, AIMD-min and AIMD-sp. The calculated ECWs for all considered ILs using the AIMD-min method are found to be close to experimental outcomes compared to other two methods. We show that the alkyl group of the imidazolium ring has a very limited effect on the ECW values. On the other hand, aromatic imidazolium rings are more prone to reduction compared to the nonaromatic pyrrolidinium ring. Moreover, we have investigated the contribution of cations and anions in cathodic and anodic potentials, from the study of density of states. Along with that, we have tested the robustness capability of the AIMD-min method and established a superior technique for other liquid systems to calculate the ECW. This work facilitates a step forward in selecting nonaqueous electrolytes for rechargeable DIBs.					; Pathak, Biswarup/F-5827-2011	Manna, Surya Sekhar/0000-0002-8496-109X; Pathak, Biswarup/0000-0002-9972-9947													1932-7447	1932-7455				MAY 10	2023	127	19					8913	8924		10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c00587	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c00587		MAY 2023											WOS:000988970600001

However, the effect of phytoplankton biomass and composition on DMS under different nutrient inputs remains poorly understood. Two comprehensive cruises to characterize their effects were conducted in spring and summer 2015. The areas with high concentrations of DMS, dimethylsulfoniopropionate (precursor of DMS), and dimethyl sulfoxide (photo-oxidation product of DMS) were largely consistent with high phytoplankton abundances along the front of Changjiang Diluted Water in both seasons. Both the higher conversion ratio of dissolved dimethylsulfoniopropionate to DMS and the higher DMS biological production rate in summer contributed to the higher DMS levels. Once produced in seawater, more than half of the DMS was directly consumed by microbes, resulting in a turnover time of 1-2 days, which was shorter than that driven by ventilation. A ship-based incubation experiment revealed that, with increasing N/Si and N/P ratios from the Changjiang River, phytoplankton biomass increased and the community shifted from diatom-dominated to dinoflagellate-dominated, which was conducive to DMS production. It was noteworthy that strong DMS photo-degradation induced by high nitrate concentrations may have masked DMS production to some extent, while urea only had a promoting effect and therefore led to a maximum increase in DMS yield. Our findings indicated that the increase in phytoplankton biomass and succession of phytoplankton community induced by changes in nutrient inputs will promote DMS emissions from the Changjiang Estuary.

Tandem Analysis of Transcriptome and Proteome Changes after a Single Dose of Corticosteroid: A Systems Approach to Liver Function in Pharmacogenomics	OMICS-A JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY												Corticosteroids (CS) such as methylprednisolone (MPL) affect almost all liver functions through multiple mechanisms of action, and long-term use results in dysregulation causing diverse side effects. The complexity of involved molecular mechanisms necessitates a systems approach. Integration of information from the transcriptomic and proteomic responses has potential to provide deeper insights into CS actions. The present report describes the tandem analysis of rich time-series transcriptomic and proteomic data in rat liver after a single dose of MPL. Hierarchical clustering of the common genes represented in both mRNA and protein datasets displayed two dominant patterns. One of these patterns exhibited complementary mRNA and protein expression profiles indicating that MPL affected the regulation of these genes at the transcriptional level. Some of the classic pharmacodynamic markers for CS actions, including tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), were among this group, together with genes encoding urea cycle enzymes and ribosomal proteins. The other pattern was rather unexpected. For this group of genes, MPL had distinctly observable effects at the protein expression level, although a change in the reverse direction occurred at the transcriptional level. These genes were functionally associated with metabolic processes that might be essential to elucidate side effects of MPL on liver, most importantly including modulation of oxidative stress, fatty acid oxidation, and bile acid biosynthesis. Furthermore, profiling of gene and protein expression data was also done independently of one another by a two-way sequential approach. Prominent temporal shifts in expression and relevant cellular functions were described together with the assessment of changes in the complementary side.

Genetic and gene expression studies have revealed heterogeneous inter- and intratumor patterns of metabolic enzymes and membrane transporters. The functional implications of this heterogeneity remain often elusive. Here, we applied a systems biology approach to gain a comprehensive and quantitative picture of metabolic changes in individual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We used protein intensity profiles determined by mass spectrometry in samples of 10 human HCCs and the adjacent noncancerous tissue to calibrate Hepatokin1, a complex mathematical model of liver metabolism. We computed the 24-h profile of 18 metabolic functions related to carbohydrate, lipid, and nitrogen metabolism. There was a general tendency among the tumors toward downregulated glucose uptake and glucose release albeit with large intertumor variability. This finding calls into question that the Warburg effect dictates the metabolic phenotype of HCC. All tumors comprised elevated beta-oxidation rates. Urea synthesis was found to be consistently downregulated but without compromising the tumor's capacity for ammonia detoxification owing to increased glutamine synthesis. The largest intertumor heterogeneity was found for the uptake and release of lactate and the size of the cellular glycogen content. In line with the observed metabolic heterogeneity, the individual HCCs differed largely in their vulnerability against pharmacological treatment with metformin. Taken together, our approach provided a comprehensive and quantitative characterization of HCC metabolism that may pave the way for a computational a priori assessment of pharmacological therapies targeting metabolic processes of HCC.

However, a lack of good animal models for examining the presence and catalytic activity of MPO in vascular lesions has impeded mechanistic studies into CKD-associated cardiovascular diseases. Here, we show for the first time that exaggerated atherosclerosis in a pathophysiologically relevant CKD mouse model is associated with increased macrophage-derived MPO activity. Male 7-week-old LDL receptor-deficient mice underwent sham (control mice) or 5/6 nephrectomy and were fed either a low-fat or high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for 24 weeks, and the extents of atherosclerosis and vascular reactivity were assessed. MPO expression and oxidation productsprotein-bound oxidized tyrosine moieties 3-chlorotyrosine, 3-nitrotyrosine, and o,o-dityrosinewere examined with immunoassays and confirmed with mass spectrometry (MS). As anticipated, the CKD mice had significantly higher plasma creatinine, urea nitrogen, and intact parathyroid hormone along with lower hematocrit and body weight. On both the diet regimens, CKD mice did not have hypertension but had lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels than the control mice. Despite the lower cholesterol levels, CKD mice had increased aortic plaque areas, fibrosis, and luminal narrowing. They also exhibited increased MPO expression and activity (i.e. increased oxidized tyrosines) that co-localized with infiltrating lesional macrophages and diminished vascular reactivity. In summary, unlike non-CKD mouse models of atherosclerosis, CKD mice exhibit increased MPO expression and catalytic activity in atherosclerotic lesions, which co-localize with lesional macrophages.

The results obtained for a carbon dose of 16 mg L-1 show that powdered activated carbon, with contact times of 60 min, obtained 81% of reduction and in 24 h 92%, while granulated activated carbon at 60 min obtained a reduction of 2%, rising to 34% after 24 h of contact time. Therefore, powdered activated carbon achieves better reductions compared to granulated; when ozone was applied at a dose of 19.7 mg L-1, with a reaction time of 18 min, a reduction of 93% was obtained, achieving a better reduction in less time than with adsorption treatments; however, during oxidation, by-products of simazine were produced. In the combined treatments, with the same doses of carbon and ozone mentioned above, the treatment that starts with ozone followed by activated carbon powder is recommended due to the adsorption in the last phase reaching a 90% reduction of the simazine and its by-products in 38 min of time.

Methods: Streptozotocin (STZ)-treated type 1 and db/db type 2 diabetes model were established, AKI model was induced in mice by ischemia-reperfusion injury(IRI). Mouse proximal tubular cell cells were subjected to high glucose and hypoxia-reoxygenation in vitro. Transcriptional RNA sequencing was performed for clustering analysis and target gene screening. Renal structural damage was determined by histological staining, whereas creatinine and urea nitrogen levels were used to measure renal function. Results: Deteriorated renal function and renal tissue damage were observed in AKI mice with diabetic background. RNA sequencing showed a decrease in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) pathway and an increase in abnormal glycolysis. Treatment with Dapa, Sitagliptin(a DPP-4 inhibitor)and insulin reduced blood glucose levels in mice, and improved renal function. However, Dapa had a superior therapeutic effect and alleviated aberrant FAO and glycosis. Dapa reduced cellular death in cultured cells under high glucose hypoxia-reoxygenation conditions, alleviated FAO dysfunction, and reduced abnormal glycolysis. RNA sequencing showed that SIRT3 expression was reduced in diabetic IRI, which was largely restored by Dapa intervention. 3-TYP, a SIRT3 inhibitor, reversed the renal protective effects of Dapa and mediated abnormal FAO and glycolysis in mice and tubular cells. Conclusion: Our study provides experimental evidence for the use of Dapa as a means to reduce diabetic AKI by ameliorating metabolic reprogramming in renal tubular cells.																			0925-4439	1879-260X				OCT	2024	1870	7							167433	10.1016/j.bbadis.2024.167433	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2024.167433		JUL 2024						39067538					WOS:001285774600001

A targeted H-1-NMR study of serum, combined with clinical variables, detected and localized biomarkers to stages of NAFLD in morbidly obese females. Pre-surgery serum samples from 100 middle-aged, morbidly obese female subjects, grouped on gold-standard liver wedge biopsies (non-NAFLD; steatosis; and fibrosis) were collected, extracted, and analyzed in aqueous (D2O) buffer (H-1, 600 MHz). Profiled concentrations were subjected to exploratory statistical analysis. Metabolites varying significantly between the non-NAFLD and steatosis groups included the ketone bodies 3-hydroxybutyrate (& DARR;; p = 0.035) and acetone (& DARR;; p = 0.012), and also alanine (& UARR;; p = 0.004) and a putative pyruvate signal (& UARR;; p = 0.003). In contrast, the steatosis and fibrosis groups were characterized by 2-hydroxyisovalerate (& UARR;; p = 0.023), betaine (& DARR;; p = 0.008), hypoxanthine (& DARR;; p = 0.003), taurine (& DARR;; p = 0.001), 2-hydroxybutyrate (& UARR;; p = 0.045), 3-hydroxyisobutyrate (& UARR;; p = 0.046), and increasing medium chain fatty acids. Exploratory classification models with and without clinical variables exhibited overall success rates ca. 75-85%. In the study conditions, inhibition of fatty acid oxidation and disruption of the hepatic urea cycle are supported as early features of NAFLD that continue in fibrosis. In fibrosis, markers support inflammation, hepatocyte damage, and decreased liver function. Complementarity of NMR concentrations and clinical information in classification models is shown. A broader hypothesis that standard-of-care sera can yield metabolomic information is supported.					xin, chu/AAC-5332-2021	Rovnyak, David/0000-0003-0328-5083														2218-1989				NOV	2021	11	11							737	10.3390/metabo11110737	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/metabo11110737								34822395					WOS:000729284800001

Despite a considerable increase in the amount of research and literature available on this topic, resistance training is undergoing important developments. Anaerobic metabolism, which characterizes resistance training, enhances the ischemic process and blood reperfusion, thereby generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). The imbalance between the production of free radicals and antioxidant defenses may induce oxidative stress with subsequent protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, DNA damage in several cells, and other effects. This process may be intensified at rest because the O(2 )deficit is counteracted by a process known as excess post-exercise oxygen consumption. Objective: To analyze the effects of ROS in strength training on the DNA of human lymphocyte, biomarkers of lipid damage (TBARS) and metabolism (triglycerides, protein, glycose, albumin and urea). Methods: Comet assay involving a count of 100 cells, which were divided into five classes of damage (no damage = 0, maximum damage = 4), thereby constituting an indication of DNA damage, and the micronucleus test, where the cell samples were centrifuged at 1000-1500 RPM for ten minutes at room temperature for the micronuclei analysis. Results: An elevation in triglyceride concentrations was observed 5h post-exercise (p=0.018), probably due to nutrition. There were no significant differences in the other biochemical parameters. In terms of the DNA damage measured by the Comet assay and micronucleus test, no statistical differences were observed until 5h post-exercise. Conclusion: The proposed training session did not cause oxidative or genotoxic damage in trained individuals under the proposed conditions.					siqueira, Luciano/D-4137-2013; REIS, VICTOR/M-3531-2013	siqueira, Luciano/0000-0002-0415-2226; Manfredini, Vanusa/0000-0002-9622-7861; Soares, Jorge Pinto/0000-0002-1447-2872; REIS, VICTOR/0000-0002-4996-1414; Tagliari, Nelson Joao/0000-0002-9031-5481													1517-8692	1806-9940				MAR-APR	2019	25	2					157	160		10.1590/1517-869220192502178893	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1517-869220192502178893													WOS:000463832100012

Among the several conversions, the production of glycerol carbonate is environmentally most attractive, as it also utilises CO2 as the carbon source, as C1 feedstock, a key to accelerate the pursuit of decarbonization and the net-zero goals. The glycerol carbonate production can be divided into two main pathways i.e., direct and indirect route based on the utilisation of CO2. There has been much interest in the direct conversion of glycerol with molecular CO2, due to its potential for sustainability and ecological advantages. Moreover, this process could be directly minimising CO2 levels in atmosphere. The indirect pathways involve the utilisation of CO2 as a source for the synthesis of reactants, for instance organic carbonates and urea. These reactants are employed as raw materials in the process of glycerol carbonate production. It is important to note that each reaction route has its own set of advantages and drawbacks. However, the important factor for all processes lies in the high catalytic performance of the suitable catalyst and the optimal reaction conditions to enhance the yield of glycerol carbonate. This review aims to evaluate the recent progress made on the catalyst design and process conditions to produce glycerol carbonate via both the direct and indirect reaction pathways. In each route, the catalytic systems based on the heterogenous catalysts, the reaction condition and catalytic performance are considered. Finally, suggested perspectives for the future direction in glycerol carbonate production focusing on the utilisation of molecular CO2 are presented.

FOOD BIOSCIENCE												Pea pods, a food waste by-product, was studied for its chemical composition and evaluated for its in vitro antioxidant, protein denaturating and anti-acetylcholinesterase (anti-AChE) and in vivo antidiabetic, anti-hyperlipidemic and cytoprotective properties in alloxan-induced diabetic mice. The pea pods had 51% fiber, 28.2% carbohydrates, 14.2% crude protein, 4.5% lipids and 4.5% ash which consisted mainly of K, Mg, Ca, Na, Fe, Zn and Cu (in descending order). The fatty acid (FA) profile showed that linoleic, linolenic and palmitic acids were the main components. Although its lipids are highly oxidation susceptible, the lipid fraction showed good nutritional attributes as shown by its low atherogenic, thrombogenic and hypoholestrolemic values. The pea pods methanol extract (PPE) showed very low antioxidant activity but it had a strong inhibitory effect on heat-induced BSA denaturation suggesting its possible anti-inflammatory effects. Oral administration of PPE to diabetic mice decreased serum glucose levels, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, urea, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase activities. It reduced lipid peroxidation, and H2O2 and SH contents, but it significantly (p < 0.05) increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, GPX and SOD) in the liver, kidney and testis. Moreover, PPE effectively reduced serum triglycerides, cholesterol and LDL and restored the hepatic, renal and testicular FA profiles suggesting its promising anti-hyperlipidemic effect. Overall, PPE could be useful to help manage diabetes and its associated hyperlipidema, to reduce the risk of oxidative stress and to decrease liver, kidney and testis damage.

Microwave-assisted Synthesis of Bile Acids Derivatives: An Overview	CURRENT ORGANIC CHEMISTRY												The first attempts at microwave-assisted (MW) syntheses of bile acid derivatives were performed in domestic MW appliances. However, the reproducibility of these syntheses, which were performed in uncontrolled conditions, was very low. In the first part of this overview, compounds synthesized under such conditions are presented. Consequently, with the development of MW technology, MW-assisted reactions in MW reactors became reproducible. Thus, in the second part of this review, syntheses of bile acids-based compounds in MW reactors are presented. Among others, publications dealing with the following topics will be covered: Chemical transformations of hydroxyl and/or carboxyl functions of bile acids into esters or amides, Hydroxyl group oxidations, Derivatization of oxo-compounds with different nitrogen-containing compounds (e.g. 4-amino-3-substituted-1H-1,2,4-triazole-5-thiones, thiocarbohydrazides and thiosemicarbazides) Bile acid-based molecular tweezers, capable of stereospecific molecular recognition Reactions of hydroxyl functions to give chlorine derivatives, presenting reactive intermediates in substitution reactions with N- or O-containing nucleophilic arylhydrazides, urea derivatives, substituted thiadiazoles or triazoles or amino acid methyl esters, mainly in solvent-free conditions. Some of the synthesized compounds expressed antimicrobial potential and/or good recognition properties as artificial receptors for specific amino acids or anions. Detailed comparisons between conventional and MW-assisted procedures for chemical transformations of bile acids are given in most of the presented publications. Based on these results, MW irradiation methods are simpler, more efficient, cleaner and faster than conventional synthetic methods, meeting the requirements of green chemistry.

The aim of our investigation was to evaluate the role of inflammation and also oxidative damage in nephrotoxic potential of GM and protective effects of Nasturtium officinale (watercress) against GM-induced nephrotoxicity in Wistar rats. Material and methods: The animals were divided into eight groups: control, solvent, GM (80mg/kg IP), GM with three doses (50, 100 and 200mg/kg/d) of hydroalcoholic extract of watercress and one group only received high dose of extract and a group which received GM plus vitamin E for 10 consecutive days. Then, the animals were killed and kidney tissues were separated. Finally reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH) content, lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyl (PCO), nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were evaluated. Also, pathological examination and measuring of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) were done. Results: The administration of GM for 10 d resulted in an increase in kidney markers (BUN and Cr) and pathological changes in kidney tissue. Also, oxidative stress was evident in GM group by increased ROS, LPO and PCO level and GSH oxidation. Increased in inflammation process was shown by increase in NO and TNF-alpha Administration of watercress extract was able to protect against deterioration in nephrotoxic markers and suppressed the increase in oxidative stress and inflammation markers. Conclusions: Our study showed the critical role of oxidative damage and inflammation in GM-induced nephrotoxicity that markedly inhibited by administration of watercress. Therefore, watercress can be suggested for prevention of GM-induced nephrotoxicity.

The produced carbons were used as adsorbents for CO2 capture. The physic-chemical properties of the produced carbons were characterized by N-2 adsorption-desorption, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The effects of pore structure and nitrogen content on CO2 adsorption were investigated. It was found that H3PO4 activation would turn cypress sawdust into mesoporous carbon (AC), nitrogen doping could induce the development of microporosity and also increase the basicity of the carbon framework, which favoured for CO2 adsorption. Among the nitrogen-tailed carbons, HNO3-treated activated carbon (AC-N) showed the highest V-mic (0.127 cm(3)/g), the largest CO2 adsorption capacity (2.8 mmol/g at 273 K, 1 bar) and the best CO2/N-2 selectivity as compared to urea and melamine treated ones. The adsorption experiments showed that the presence of microporosity and pyrrolic-N on the carbons were responsible for CO2 adsorption, the oxygen functional groups on AC-N might also contribute to higher CO2 uptake, and the mesoporous structure could favour for the fast mass transfer of CO2. The results of CO2 adsorption heat confirmed the high affinity of the prepared carbons to CO2. This study provides a strategy to produce hierarchical meso-/micro-porous activated carbons with enriched nitrogen functional groups, which favoured for CO2 adsorption.

Oxidative stress and inflammation play the major role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Studies that examined by-products of oxidative stress in psoriasis show discrepant results. Hence, we aimed to examine the oxidative stress, inflammation and metabolic markers and to explore their potential relationship with disease severity in patients with psoriasis. Methods: This case-control study comprised of 35 patients with psoriasis and 35 age, sex and body mass indexmatched healthy controls. Metabolic and oxidative stress biomarkers [i.e., malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and catalase (CAT)] were measured. The principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to reduce the number of measured variables into smaller number of factors. PCA factors were subsequently used in logistic regression analysis for severe psoriasis prediction. Results: Higher AOPP levels (p<0.01) and CAT activity (p<0.001), but no difference in MDA levels in psoriasis patients vs. healthy controls were shown. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that a combination of metabolic related factor (i.e., glucose and triglycerides) and renal function related factor (i.e., creatinine and urea) was the best model for Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) >10 prediction, while oxidative stress-hepatic related factor (i.e., MDA, alanine aminotransferase) was selected as the best predictor for Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) >20. Conclusion: Multimarker approach showed that metabolic and renal function related factor and oxidative stresshepatic related factor were better predictors of psoriasis severity than each single examined biomarker.

Extremely high NH3 and NH4+ con-centrations were observed after a precipitation event within 7-10 days following urea application. Elevated NH3 levels coincided with elevated NH4+, indicating that NH3 likely influenced particulate ammonium mass. For the sampling period, the average conversion / oxidation ratios for NH4+ (NHR), SO42- (SOR), and NO3- (NOR) were estimated to be 0.30, 0.64, and 0.24, respectively. The increased NH3 concentrations, mainly from agricultural activities and regional transport, coincided with the prevailing meteorological conditions. The high NH3 level with NHR of about 0.30 indicates that the emission of NH3 in the NCP is much higher than needed for aerosol acid neutralisation, and NH3 plays an important role in the formation of secondary aerosols as a key neutraliser. The hourly data obtained were used to investigate gas-aerosol partitioning characteristics using the thermodynamic equilibrium model ISORROPIA-II. Modelled SO42-, NO3-, and NH3 values agree well with the measurements, while the modelled NH4+ values largely underestimate the measurements. Our observation and modelling results indicate that strong acids in aerosol are completely neutralised. Additional NH4+ exists in aerosol, probably a result of the presence of a substantial amount of oxalic and other diacids.

Using a PVC substrate and pencil drawing technique, electrodes were fabricated and modified with niobium oxide and graphene oxide via a straightforward "drop casting" method. The nanostructures of the substrate, electrode, and modified electrode were evaluated using SEM images. The synergistic effect between these materials significantly facilitated the uric acid oxidation process with a 400 mV peak potential shift and 45% current increase. The evaluation of the electrode's response to common blood and urine components showed minimal deviation. Among the components tested-ascorbic acid, glucose, nitrate, nitrite, cysteine, urea, creatinine, and ammonium ion-only the ammonium ion exhibited a 10% interference at concentrations commonly found in urine. The sensors showed a good detection limit of 8.7 mu mol L-1, with a wide linear range from 8.7 to 2000 mu mol L-1 with a correlation factor of 0.9993 for five different sensors. The reproducibility and repeatability of the produced sensors were estimated by the RSD at 4% and 1%, respectively. Synthetic urine samples spiked exhibited reliable analysis, with recovery values within a 5% error margin. This work presents a practical, simple, and affordable sensor platform for rapid and accurate UA quantification.

In normoxic water, A. gigas is reported to satisfy 70-80% of its O-2 requirement from the air while excreting 60-90% of its CO2 to the water. If this pattern of gas exchange were to continue in severely hypoxic water, O-2 loss at the gills would be expected. We hypothesized therefore that partitioning of CO2 would shift to the air phase in severe aquatic hypoxia, eliminating the risk of branchial O2 loss. By adapting a respirometer designed to measure aquatic <(M) over dot>(O2)/<(M) over dot>(CO2), we were able to run intermittent closed respirometry on both water and air phase for both of these gasses as well as sample water for N-waste measurements (ammonia-N, urea-N) so as to calculate metabolic fuel utilization. In contrast to our prediction, we found that partitioning of CO2 excretion changed little between normoxia and severe hypoxia (83% versus 77% aquatic excretion, respectively) and at the same time there was no evidence of branchial O-2 loss in hypoxia. This indicates that A. gigas can utilize distinct transfer pathways for O-2 and CO2. Routine and standard <(M)over dot>(O2), N-waste excretion and metabolic fuel utilization did not change with water oxygenation. Metabolism was fuelled mostly by protein oxidation (53%), while carbohydrates and lipids accounted for 27% and 20%, respectively.

Methods: We use the treadmill to establish a fatigue model caused by exercise, and perform drug treatment after exercise. We tested the exhaustive exercise time of mice; investigated the changes of mice body weight, liver index, histopathology, serum biochem-ical indicators and mRNA expression levels of oxidative and inflammation-related genes; and assessed the potential fatigue inhibitory effect of CQPC08, and the anti-oxidation effect of the combination of GOS and CQPC08. Results: The results suggest that CQPC08 and combination with GOS reduces fatigue-induced oxidative damage of the liver, and it decreases blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactic acid (LA), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT), malonaldehyde (MDA), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-6 in serum. Higher levels of serum catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were found. Treatment with the CQPC08 and combination with GOS correlates with lower relative mRNA expression levels of neuronal NOS (nNOS), iNOS, and TNF-alpha, and with higher mRNA expression levels of catalase and copper/zinc (Cu/Zn) and manganese (Mn) SOD enzymes in the liver and muscles. Conclusion: These results suggest that CQPC08 can resolve exercise-induced fatigue by improving antioxidant ability in mice, and the combination of GOS and CQPC08 enhances this ability of CQPC08.

J	Maldonado, C; Vázquez, M; Fagiolino, P				Maldonado, Cecilia; Vazquez, Marta; Fagiolino, Pietro			Potential Therapeutic Role of Carnitine and Acetylcarnitine in Neurological Disorders	CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN												Background: Current therapy of neurological disorders has several limitations. Although a high number of drugs are clinically available, several subjects do not achieve full symptomatic remission. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the therapeutic potential of L-carnitine (LCAR) and acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) because of the multiplicity of actions they exert in energy metabolism, as antioxidants, neuromodulators and neuroprotectors. They also show excellent safety and tolerability profile. Objective: To assess the role of LCAR and ALCAR in neurological disorders. Methods: A meticulous review of the literature was conducted in order to establish the linkage between LCAR and ALCAR and neurological diseases. Results: LCAR and ALCAR mechanisms and effects were studied for Alzheimers disease, depression, neuropathic pain, bipolar disorder, Parkinsons disease and epilepsy in the elderly. Both substances exert their actions mainly on primary metabolism, enhancing energy production, through beta-oxidation, and the ammonia elimination via urea cycle promotion. These systemic actions impact positively on the Central Nervous System state, as Ammonia and energy depletion seem to underlie most of the neurotoxic events, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, membrane degeneration, and neurotransmitters disbalances, present in neurological disorders, mainly in the elderly. The impact on bipolar disorder is controversial. LCAR absorption seems to be impaired in the elderly due to the decrease of active transportation; therefore, ALCAR seems to be the more effective option to administer. Conclusion: ALCAR emerges as a simple, economical and safe adjuvant option in order to impair the progression of most neurological disorders.

Herein, we have reported a strongly coupled 3D hybrid electrocatalyst, which consists of N-doped MoO2 with Ni3S2 grown on Ni foam (N-MoO2/Ni3S2 NF) through an annealing treatment, followed by a thermal ammonia reaction. This N-MoO2/Ni3S2 with a particle size of similar to 50 nm was evenly grown on the Ni substrate in this 3D hybrid system. Benefiting from the strong coupling effect, the N-MoO2/Ni3S2 NF exhibited a high HER performance in basic media, with a small value of the Tafel slope (76 mV dec(-1)) and a low potential of 517 mV at 1000 mA cm(-2), which was superior to that of Pt/C (631 mV at 1000 mA cm(-2)). Experimental results revealed that constructing a coupling interface between N-MoO2 and Ni3S2 facilitated the absorption and dissociation of water molecules, consequently boosting the HER activity. Additionally, the 3D N-MoO2/Ni3S2 NF hybrid could act as a bifunctional electrode for both anode (biomass upgrading) and cathode (HER), which only required a lower potential of 2.08 V at 100 mA cm(-2) as compared to the overall water splitting (2.25 V) and achieved a high biomass conversion ratio of over 90%. Moreover, substituting oxygen evolution reaction by urea oxidation reaction also can assist energy-saving hydrogen evolution for 3D N-MoO2/Ni3S2 NF.					lei, lecheng/LSL-4393-2024; YANG, Bin/LSM-4113-2024; Cao, Junhui/LSL-5522-2024; Zhang, Xingwang/I-3364-2014; Hou, Yang/J-9472-2017; Li, Zhongjian/H-5721-2013; YANG, Bin/LSL-6119-2024	YANG, Bin/0000-0002-5136-9743; Dai, Qizhou/0000-0001-6966-1518; Lei, Chaojun/0000-0002-6059-5689													1944-8244	1944-8252				AUG 7	2019	11	31					27743	27750		10.1021/acsami.9b06502	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b06502								31305069					WOS:000480498600027

Furthermore, contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an iatrogenic impairment of renal function in patients subjected to angiographic procedures for which there is not yet a successful preventative treatment. Recent evidence has shown that this event is related to tubular/vascular injury activated mainly by oxidative stress. However, whether this bioavailable and pharmacologically safe extract protects against CIN is not clear. We proposed to evaluate the possible protective role of the antioxidant silymarin in an experimental model of CIN. Adult male Swiss mice were separated into 6 groups and pretreated orally with silymarin (50, 200 and 300 mg/kg), N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg) or vehicle for 5 days before the CIN and control groups. Renal function was analyzed by plasma creatinine, urea and cystatin C levels. Additionally, blood reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated using ROS bioavailability, protein oxidation and DNA damage. Renal oxidative damage was evaluated using apoptosis/cell viability assays and histological analysis. We showed that silymarin preserved renal function and decreased systemic and renal oxidative damage (antigenotoxic and antiapoptotic properties, respectively) in a dose-dependent manner and was superior to conventional treatment with N-acetylcysteine. Histologically, silymarin treatment also had beneficial effects on renal glomerular and tubular injuries. Therefore, silymarin prophylaxis may be an interesting strategy for the prevention of CIN.

Surprisingly, hyperammonemia was present at an age of 3 and 12 months despite normal tissue integrity. This was accompanied by cerebral RNA oxidation. As shown in liver perfusion experiments, glutamine production from ammonia was diminished in TauT KO mice, whereas urea production was not affected. In livers from 3-month-old TauT KO mice protein expression and activity of glutamine synthetase (GS) were unaffected, whereas the ammonia-transporting RhBG protein was down-regulated by about 50%. Double reciprocal plot analysis of glutamine synthesis versus perivenous ammonia concentration revealed that TauT KO had no effect on the capacity of glutamine formation in 3-monthold mice, but doubled the ammonia concentration required for half-maximal glutamine synthesis. Since hepatic RhBG expression is restricted to GS-expressing hepatocytes, the findings suggest that an impaired ammonia transport into these cells impairs glutamine synthesis. In livers from 12-, but not 3-month-old TauT KO mice, RhBG expression was not affected, surrogate markers for oxidative stress were strongly up-regulated, and GS activity was decreased by 40% due to an inactivating tyrosine nitration. Thiswas also reflected by kinetic analyses in perfused liver, which showed a decreased glutamine synthesizing capacity by 43% and a largely unaffected ammonia concentration dependence. It is concluded that TauT deficiency triggers hyperammonemia through impaired hepatic glutamine synthesis due to an impaired ammonia transport via RhBG at 3 months and a tyrosine nitration-dependent inactivation of GS in 12-month-old TauT KO mice.

J	Shi, WJ; Fan, H; Ai, SY; Zhu, LS				Shi, Weijie; Fan, Hai; Ai, Shiyun; Zhu, Lusheng			Honeycomb-like nitrogen-doped porous carbon supporting Pt nanoparticles as enzyme mimic for colorimetric detection of cholesterol	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL												Lignin obtained from black liquor had been successfully used as a precursor to prepare honeycomb-like nitrogen-doped porous carbon (PCN) assisted with urea. Then Pt nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on honeycomb-like PCN by glycol reduction to form Pt nanoparticles supported on PCN (Pt/PCN). The obtained Pt/PCN was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which showed that Pt nanoparticles with an average size of 4 nm were uniformly dispersed on the surface of honeycomb-like PCN. The prepared Pt/PCN was found to have much higher catalytic activity than individual Pt nanoparticles and PCN, which can catalyze oxidation of the peroxidase substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of H2O2 to produce a blue color reaction, the detection limit of H2O2 can be reached to 1.7 x 10(-6) M. Therefore, a rapid, selective and sensitive colorimetric method for the cholesterol detection was developed with the detection limit of 8.3 x 10(-6) M. The method used lignin as the main raw material to prepare Pt/PCN is facile, low cost and rich in resource, and the prepared Pt/PCN is successfully applied as enzyme mimic for colorimetric detection of cholesterol sensitively. It is believed that this work not only provides a potential way to utilize the black-liquor lignin, but also puts forward a novel method for the detection of cholesterol in human body.

The as -prepared carbon is composited with Zn(O,S) to form Zn(O,S)/C with different carbon con-tents of 1, 2.5, and 5 wt%. All the nanocomposites are identified with XRD, SEM, Raman, TEM, XPS, FTIR, and EPR analyses. The optical and electrochemical properties are also analyzed with DRS, Tauc plot, PL, EIS, TPC, MS, and CV measurements. Furthermore, the amounts of generated hydrogen gas are evaluated in the presence of Zn(O,S), ZC-1, ZC-2.5, and ZC-5 nanocomposites under simulated solar light irradiation. ZC-2.5 with an appro-priate amount of banana peels carbon generates 9232 mmol/g in a 5-h photocatalytic reaction. The HER rate is enhanced by 1.7 times compared to pristine Zn(O,S). Incorporating low-cost banana peels carbon improves the separation between photogenerated electron and hole as the active site of carbon in ZC-2.5 attract the electron for hydrogen reduction. In addition, the generated Vo sites on Zn(O,S) during the photocatalytic reaction also in-crease the water and alcohol oxidation to scavenger the generated holes. This work designed a simple catalytic system with low-cost and environmentally-friendly material to provide an alternative energy source by harvesting solar light energy.

This evaporitic system, localy with a clear karstic functioning, is characterized by groundwater with a wide range of mineralization. Hydrochemical and multi-isotopic (delta S-34, delta O-18, delta N-15, delta C-13 and delta H-2) techniques were used to understand the geochemical processes leading to pollutant attenuation within the complexes. There, regional groundwater evolve from recharge/transition areas, with low salinity, to the discharge zone. Mineralization of groundwater depends on the dissolution of evaporitic deposits (gypsum, halite) of Keuper age, which increases salinity of the water drained by the outlet springs. delta N-15 and delta O-18 values of dissolved nitrate (NO3-) were used to estimate the relative contribution of N sources. NO3- is mainly derived from agricultural inputs (nitrate and urea fertilizers). Long-residence groundwater plays an important role in the biogeochemical evolution. Denitrification is responsible for NO3- removal in transitional zones and discharge springs. This process is promoted by the oxidation of organic carbon, derived from recharge areas and further transported to deeper zones of the aquifer. The findings of this study provide a new understanding of how hydrogeological functioning is connected to pollutant removal in an evaporitic karst system, where the scale of groundwater flows plays a key role in biogeochemical processes.

In the present investigation, we have attempted to address whether a combination of BCAAs supplement consumption with aerobic exercise could elaborate the expression of PPAR gamma, Pgc-1 alpha and Fndc5 genes in gastrocnemius muscle and heart tissue of male C57BL/6 mice. Methods: Thirty-six young male mice with an average weight of 18 +/- 2 g were selected. Mice were randomly assigned to 6 groups: 20 mg/mL of BCAAs consumption with simultaneous exercise-training, 60 mg/mL of BCAAs consumption with simultaneous exercise-training, exercise-trained with no BCAAs consumption group, 20 mg/mL BCAAs without exercise-training, 60 mg/mL BCAAs without exercise-training, and untrained mice without BCAAs consumption. Results: The findings showed a combination of 20 mg/mL BCAAs with aerobic exercise significantly increased Fndc5, PPAR gamma, Pgc-1 alpha gene expression in skeletal muscles although, circulating Irisin levels remained unchanged (p < 0.05). Interestingly, plasma urea and lactate levels were significantly increased in 60 mg/mL BCAAs administrated mice which performed exercised (p < 0.05). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine significant difference between groups and sedentary group. Conclusions: Results showed inductive effect of 20 mg/mL BCAAs on expression levels of Fndc5, PPAR gamma, Pgc-1 alpha in gastrocnemius muscle similar with counterparts in heart tissue. Of note, higher serum irisin levels were detected after 20 mg/mL BCAAs supplementation coincided with the exercise.

MC PA6/UFG-AHPDMS nanocomposites were synthesized via in situ polymerization from the stable colloidal suspension of UFG-AHPDMS/CL melt. AHPDMS molecules were confirmed to be grafted onto UFG layers through the aliphatic hydroxyl groups of AHPDMS and amino groups of UFG, and the UFG-AHPDMS hybrid exhibited better distribution in matrix with strong interfacial bonding and no phase separation occurring. In comparison with neat MC PA6, the introduction of UFG-AHPDMS resulted in a 20% and 24% increase in tensile strength and impact strength for the MC PA6/UFG-AHPDMS nanocomposite, higher than those of the MC PA6/UFG and MC PA6/AHPDMS composites, indicating the reinforcing and toughening effect of UFG-AHPDMS. Meanwhile, the friction coefficient and specific wear rate respectively decreased by more than 58% and 49% with a relatively smooth worn surface and narrower worn depth distribution, confirming the excellent synergistic friction reduction and anti-wear effect of UFG-AHPDMS on MC PA6. Moreover, a uniform and continuous UFG-AHPDMS hybrid tribofilm was formed by tribochemical reaction during the friction process, and was responsible for the reduction of the friction coefficient and wear rate.

In this study, a series of g-C3N4/ZnO nanocomposites were prepared through two distinct procedures of a low-cost, environmentally-friendly, in-situ fabrication process, with urea and zinc acetate being the only precursor materials. The physicochemical properties of synthesized g-C3N4/ZnO composites were mainly characterized by XRD, UV-VIS diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), N-2 adsorption-desorption, FTIR, TEM, and SEM. These nanocomposites' photocatalytic properties were evaluated in methylene blue (MB) dye photodecomposition under UV and sunlight irradiation. Interestingly, compared with ZnO nanorods, g-C3N4/ZnO nanocomposites (x:1, obtained from urea and ZnO nanorods) exhibited weak photocatalytic activity likely due to a "shading effect", while nanocomposites (x:1 CN, made from g-C3N4 and zinc acetate) showed enhanced photocatalytic activity that can be ascribed to the effective establishment of heterojunctions. A kinetics study showed that a maximum reaction rate constant of 0.1862 min(-1) can be achieved under solar light illumination, which is two times higher than that of bare ZnO nanorods. The photocatalytic mechanism was revealed by determining reactive species through adding a series of scavengers. It suggested that reactive center dot O-2(-) and h(+) radicals played a major role in promoting dye photodegradation.

Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a redox-active enzyme, helps to form and isomerize the disulfide bonds, thereby acting as a chaperone. Such activity is essential for activating many essential enzymes and functional proteins. Brugia malayi protein disulfide isomerase (BmPDI) is crucial for parasite survival and an important drug target. Here, we used a combination of spectroscopic and computational analysis to study the structural and functional changes in the BmPDI during unfolding. Tryptophan fluorescence data revealed two well-separated transitions during the unfolding process, suggesting that the unfolding of the BmPDI is non-cooperative. The binding of the fluorescence probe 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid dye (ANS) validated the results obtained by the pH unfolding. The dynamics of molecular simulation performed at different pH conditions revealed the structural basis of BmPDI unfolding. Detailed analysis suggested that under different pH, both the global structure and the conformational dynamics of the active site residues were differentially altered. Our multiparametric study reveals the differential dynamics and collective motions of BmPDI unfolding, providing insights into its structure-function relationship.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Enhancement of p-nitrophenol adsorption capacity through N2-thermal-based treatment of activated carbons	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE												In this work several activated carbons showing different textural and chemical properties were obtained by chemical and physical activation methods, using a lignocellulosic material (peach stones) as precursor. The activated carbon resulting from the chemical activation, namely as CAC, revealed the best textural properties (S-BET =1521 m(2) g(-1), pore volume =0.90 cm(3) g(-1)) and an acidic character. It was found that the activated carbon obtained at 300 degrees C (under air atmosphere, PAC_air), and those synthesized at 750 degrees C in presence of N-2 flow with bubbling of water/12 M H3PO4 solution (PAC_N-2(H2O)/PAC_N-2(H3PO4)), respectively, revealed worse textural properties, compared to CAC. Two functionalization treatments, by using sulphuric acid at boiling temperature (PACS) and nitric acid-urea-N-2 heating at 800 degrees C (PAC-NUT), were applied to PAC_air, in order to enhance the adsorption ability of the carbon material. Several techniques were carried out to characterize the physical and chemical properties of the obtained carbon materials. The modification treatments had influence on the carbon surface properties, since the nitric acid urea -N-2 heating treatment led to a carbon material with highly-improved properties (S-BET = 679 m(2) g(-1) pH(IEP) =5.3). Accordingly, the original and modified-carbon materials were tested as adsorbents to remove 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), assessing batch and fixed-bed column adsorption tests. PAC-NUT carbon offered the best adsorption behavior (q(e) = 234 mg g(-1)), showing a high ability for the removal of 4-NP from water. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, due to lack of cultivated AOA strains from WWTPs, their functions and contributions in these systems remain unclear. Here we report a novel AOA strain SAT1 enriched from activated sludge, with its physiological and genomic characteristics investigated. The maximal 16S rRNA gene similarity between SAT1 and other reported AOA strain is 96% (with "Ca. Nitrosotenuis chungbukensis"), and it is affiliated with Wastewater Cluster B (WWC-B) based on amoA gene phylogeny, a cluster within group I.1a and specific for activated sludge. Our strain is autotrophic, mesophilic (25 degrees C-33 degrees C) and neutrophilic (pH 5.0-7.0). Its genome size is 1.62 Mb, with a large fragment inversion (accounted for 68% genomic size) inside. The strain could not utilize urea due to truncation of the urea transporter gene. The lack of the pathways to synthesize usual compatible solutes makes it intolerant to high salinity (> 0.03%), but could adapt to low salinity (0.005%) environments. This adaptation, together with possibly enhanced cell-biofilm attachment ability, makes it suitable for WWTPs environment. We propose the name "Candidatus Nitrosotenuis cloacae" for the strain SAT1.

Elimination of bio-refractory chlorinated herbicides like atrazine, alachlor, and chlorbromuron from aqueous effluents by Fenton, electro-Fenton, and peroxi-coagulation methods	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT					Conference on Desalination for the Environment - Clean Water and Energy	MAY 11-15, 2014	Limassol, CYPRUS					Alachlor, atrazine (broad-leaf herbicides), and chlorbromuron (photosynthesis inhibitor) have been used worldwide to control weeds in crops. Their extensive use have led to widespread contamination of soils, and water which has consequently led to increasing concern about the environmental fate of these substances, since these herbicides are persistent in the environment and exhibit relatively slow rate of decomposition. Several advanced oxidation processes have been used to degrade such bio-refractory organic contaminants present in wastewater. The Fenton process is classified among these processes and has been used for the removal of many hazardous organics from wastewater efficiently. This study reports the removal of alachlor, atrazine, and chlorbromuron from aqueous effluents by classical Fenton, electro-Fenton, peroxi-coagulation, and photoperoxicoagulation processes in slightly acidic aqueous solutions. A UV lamp was used to assist the peroxi-coagulation process. Herbicide concentration decrease during the oxidation processes was followed by HPLC and chemical oxygen demand (COD) analyses. The reaction for the removal of these herbicides follows apparent-first-order kinetics. Photoperoxi-coagulation was better than electro-Fenton process. The use of UV-light irradiation during the herbicide elimination by peroxi-coagulation achieved total COD removal at 75 min for all the three herbicides treated. In the absence of UV-light irradiation, COD removals of 96, 97, and 93% were achieved for 83.3 mg/L alachlor, 62.0 mg/L of atrazine, and 35.0 mg/L of chlorbromuron, respectively.

In this study, the hydrophilic epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and the hydrophobic quercetin were simultaneously enriched in the cavity of phytoferritin from red bean seed deprived of iron (apoRBF), a cagelike protein. The interactions of apoRBF with EGCG and quercetin were evaluated by UV/visible absorption, fluorescence, and circular dichroism technologies. By combination of the reversible assembly and urea induced approaches, both EGCG and quercetin were successfully coencapsulated in apoRBF to fabricate four kinds of apoRBF-EGCG-quercetin nanocomplexes FEQ (FEQ1, FEQ2, FEQ3, and FEQ4) with good solubility in aqueous solution. All FEQ samples maintained the typically spherical morphology of ferritin cage with a diameter around 12 nm. Among the four FEQ samples, the FEQ1 prepared by involving a pH 2.0/6.7 transition scheme was more effective in encapsulating EGCG and quercetin molecules than that by the urea induced method. Furthermore, all FEQs facilitated the stability of EGCG and quercetin molecules relative to free ones, and simultaneous coencapsulation of EGCG and quercetin could significantly improve the quercetin stability as compared with that of the free one and quercetin-loaded ferritin (p < 0.05), respectively. This work provides a new scheme to design and fabricate the ferritin based carrier for encapsulation of multiple bioactive components, and it is beneficial for the intensification of multifunction in one food substrate.

One of these reactions is the homocoupling reaction of terminal alkynes, known as the Glaser coupling reaction. In this study, first, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets with high surface area and chemical stability were synthesized. Afterwards, the surface of this nano-substrate was modified with polyethyleneimine as a chelating agent to obtain g-C3N4/PEI. Finally, copper(I) was added to the nanocomposite, and the Cu(I)@g-C3N4/PEI catalyst was synthesized. The active site of copper(I) in this catalyst was calculated to be 0.16 mol in 100 g Cu(I)@g-C3N4/PEI. The synthesized catalyst was characterized by different methods such as FTIR, XRD, ICP, SEM, EDX, and mapping. Also, a deep eutectic solvent (a mixture of choline chloride and urea) was synthesized and used as a green solvent in this reaction. The reaction was performed at 100 degrees C for 30 min, and the yield was obtained as 90%. The advantages of this reaction include easy catalyst separation and reusability thanks to its heterogeneous nature, the use of a deep eutectic solvent as a green solvent, which results in a clean reaction with good to excellent efficiency, and finally short reaction time.					mahyari, mojtaba/ABH-2199-2021														1011-372X	1572-879X				OCT	2023	153	10					2989	3002		10.1007/s10562-022-04188-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10562-022-04188-9		NOV 2022											WOS:000879659900002

All of the catalysts were characterized by XRD, BET surface area, SEM, TEM, TPR and TGA analysis, respectively. The effect of the support composition as well as the metal loading on the autothermal reforming (ATR) of ethane was evaluated in a fixed-bed flow reactor at temperatures ranging from 300 to 700 degrees C. In the activity test, the Ni/CZUWA catalyst exhibited enhanced activity, which may be attributable to low levels of carbon deposition. The principal drawback-the decrease in the catalyst activity as the result of carbon deposition-was overcome by optimizing the catalyst preparation technique. From SEM analysis, Ni/CZUWA depicted nano-fiber morphology, whereas the other Ni/CZW and Ni/CZUW catalysts evidenced carbon clusters on its surface, which demonstrates clearly that the former is better than the latter for ethane reforming. The TPR results show that the Ni particles were more thoroughly dispersed in Ni/CZUWA catalyst than in the other catalysts. Depending on the composition and metal loading, a solid solution and/or a highly dispersed nickel oxide in ceria (or ceria-zirconia) can be obtained. The TGA data also supported the SEM observations, which illustrated approximately 5% less carbon deposition for the Ni/CZUWA catalyst. [GRAPHICS] .

Biofertilizer application has been considered as an alternative option for agriculture sustainability and soil improvement. In this study, field trials were carried out to investigate the efficiency of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (BA) biofertilizer on alleviating ammonia volatilization in alkaline farmland soil and increasing crop yield and nitrogen utilization. Potential response mechanisms were investigated from soil enzyme, nitrogen cycle function genes and microbial community levels. Compared with conventional fertilization, BA biofertilizer application reduced the ammonia volatilization by 68%, increased the crop yield and nitrogen recovery by 19% and 19%, respectively. Soil enzyme activity analysis showed that BA biofertilizer inhibited the urease activity and enhanced the potential ammonia oxidation (PAO). In addition, BA biofertilizer application also increased the bacterial amoA gene abundance, while decreased the ureC gene abundance. BA biofertilizer also significantly altered the community structure and composition, and especially raised the abundance of ammonia oxidation bacteria (AOB), while no changes were observed in abundance of nitrite oxidation bacteria (NOB). Briefly, BA biofertilizer was approved to reduce the transformation of fertilizer nitrogen to NH4+-N, simultaneously accelerating NH4+-N into the nitrification process, thus decreasing the NH4+-N content remained in alkaline soil and consequently alleviating the ammonia volatilization. Thus, these results suggested that the application of BA biofertilizer is a feasible strategy to improve crop yields and reduce agricultural ammonia emissions.					sun, bo/JFA-9978-2023; Bai, Zhihui/O-5303-2019; Zhuang, Guoqiang/M-4129-2018; Liu, Xiaoyang/JUV-8314-2023; Bai, Zhihui/M-9290-2014	Bai, Zhihui/0000-0002-3818-527X; zhuang, guo qiang/0000-0001-8755-7300													0013-9351	1096-0953				NOV	2021	202								111672	10.1016/j.envres.2021.111672	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111672		JUL 2021						34265351					WOS:000704954400003

Herein, coprecipitated cobalt-ceria (CoCeOx) oxides doped with Ir (IrCoCeOx) were synthesized and used to assess the performances of metal/oxide interfaces in the N2H4<middle dot>H2O decomposition performed in aqueous NaOH. Kinetic experiments in batch showed that CoO is the active phase of CoCeOx and that the copresence of Ir and Co (IrCoCeOx) enhanced H-2 productivity. A comprehensive characterization (X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy) combined with robust computational modeling based on the density functional theory was employed to attribute the IrCoCeOx performance enhancement to the Ir/CoO metal/oxide interface, the active site of the reaction. On these sites, the improved H-2 productivity in the presence of aqueous NaOH was studied operando through modulated excitation-attenuated total reflectance infrared coupled with phase sensitive detection. The formation of surface Co-hydroxyl and -imido groups at the Ir/CoO interface induced the preferential breakage of the N-H bond of N2H4<middle dot>H2O, favoring the production of H-2.

J	Saber, O				Saber, Osama			New trend for synthesizing of magnetic nanorods with titanomaghemite structure	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS												This research aims at developing magnetic and optical materials through fabrication of uniform nanorods by facile and novel technique. In this trend, titanium and iron were successfully combined together forming nanorods without template or high temperature by urea hydrolysis. TEM images showed uniform and homogeneous nanorods with dimensions; 10 nm in width and 50 nm in length. In the same time, fine nanoparticles were observed around the nanorods. With further treatment for the nanorods at high temperature and pressure, FESEM images revealed that the dimensions of the rods slightly increased to be 70 nm in length and 12 nm in width with a complete disappearance of the nanoparticles. Using X-ray diffraction, thermal analyses and infrared spectra in addition to the results of the electron microscopy, the oriented attachment mechanism was suggested for the formation of titanium iron oxides nanorods. The magnetic measurements revealed that the prepared nanorods possess ferromagnetic behavior and exhibit high saturation magnetization. Also, the optical properties showed that the nanorods have high absorption in the visible region and possess low band gap energy. Finally, we concluded that it is probably the first time to prepare nanorods by urea hydrolysis. The advanced optical and magnetic properties give the prepared nanorods relevance to use as building blocks in functional nanoscale devices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lu, ZZ; Liu, D; Zhou, JT; Dong, F				Lu, Zhenzhen; Liu, Dong; Zhou, Jianting; Dong, Fan			Lower treating temperature leading to higher air purification activity	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												Polymeric graphitic carbon nitride is an efficient visible-light photocatalyst for NO removal which can be prepared by precursors rich in C and N elements, such as melamine, dicyandiamide, urea, and thiourea et al. The method of synthesizing carbon nitride from melamine and dicyandiamide has much higher yield and, whereas the photocatalytic efficiency of the product was lower than that of synthesizing from urea and thiourea. In present work, the photocatalytic performance of carbon nitride prepared from dicyandiamide was significantly improved; melem/g-C3N4 was prepared from dicyandiamide under lower temperature with superior performance on NO purification than pure carbon nitride (g-C3N4). Suitable depolymerization ratio and surface protonation status could bring about higher photocatalytic activity through XPS characterizations. Through the SEM images, two kinds of morphology nanorod carbon nitride and bulk carbon nitride cross each other together and the ratio variation are consistent with reaction temperature and time. The different band gap structure between g-C3N4 and melem could drive the photogenerated electron-hole separation due to the offsets and lead to higher NO removal efficiency. This heterojunction cdnsisted of melem and g-C3N4 was developed here just by adjusting reaction temperature and time, which could open up a new possibility for air purification in a low cost way.

Here we report an environmentally benign and cost-efficient synthesis of nitriles from the direct oxidative cyanation of primary carbon-hydrogen bonds with easily available molecular oxygen and urea. The key to this success is to design and synthesize manganese oxide catalysts fixed inside zeolite crystals, forming a manganese oxide catalyst with zeolite sheath (MnOx@S-1), which exhibits high selectivity for producing nitriles by efficiently facilitating the oxidative cyanation reaction and hindering the side hydration reaction. The work delineates a sustainable strategy for synthesizing nitriles while avoiding conventional toxic cyanide, which might open a new avenue for selective transformation of carbon-hydrogen bonds.

The CDs/NDs show superior photocatalytic efficiency (98.1% MB degradation) and a higher rate constant (17.9 x 10(-3) min(-1)). The high photocatalytic performance of CDs/NDs materials is attributed to the enhanced separation of photogenerated carriers.

On the basis, P doped g-C3N4 (PCN) photocatalyst with midgap states was prepared by the polymerization of urea and etidronic acid, in order to enhance the role of main species in SMX removal via tailoring band gap structure. Compared with g-C3N4, the energy gap, CB position and VB position of PCN change little, however, PCN shows lower recombination efficiency of photogenerated carriers, strong adsorption and harvest of more visible light due to the midgap states induced by P doping, which is favorable to improve the photocatalytic activity. When the additive amount of etidronic acid is 0.03 g for 10 g urea, the obtained PCN-0.03 exhibits excellent visible-driven photocatalytic ability on SMX degradation. The kinetic constant is 2.1 times than that of pure g-C3N4. Electron spin resonance tests and trapping experiments imply that (OH)-O-center dot, holes and O-center dot(2)- are produced and enhanced by PCN-0.03 under visible light in comparison with g-C3N4. Holes and O-center dot(2)- take the primary role in SMX photodegradation. The detailed and systematical work may provide an effective strategy for water purification, especially containing SMX.

Enhanced photocatalytic degradation of Amaranth dye on mesoporous anatase TiO2: evidence of C-N, N=N bond cleavage and identification of new intermediates	PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The photocatalytic degradation mechanism of Amaranth, a recalcitrant carcinogenic azo dye, was investigated using mesoporous anatase TiO2 under sunlight. Mesoporous anatase TiO2 of a high photocatalytic activity has been synthesized using a sol-gel method and its photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Amaranth dye has been evaluated with respect to Degussa P25. The effect of bi-dentate complexing agents like oxalic acid, ethylene glycol and urea on the surface properties of TiO2 catalyst has been investigated using TG-DTA, FTIR, HR-TEM, SAED, PXRD, EDS, UV-DRS, PL, BET N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherm studies and BJH analysis. The influence of catalyst properties such as the mesoporous network, pore volume and surface area on the kinetics of degradation of Amaranth as a function of irradiation time under natural sunlight has been monitored using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The highest rate constant value of 0.069 min(-1) was obtained for the photocatalytic degradation of Amaranth using TiO2 synthesized via a urea assisted sol-gel synthesis method. The effect of the reaction conditions such as pH, TiO2 concentration and Amaranth concentration on the photodegradation rate has been investigated. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of synthesized TiO2 in comparison with P25 is attributed to the mesoporous nature of the catalyst leading to increased pore diameter, pore volume, surface area and enhanced charge carrier separation efficiency. New intermediates of photocatalytic degradation of Amaranth, namely, sodium-3-hydroxynaphthalene-2,7-disulphonate, 3-hydroxynaphthalene, sodium-4-aminonaphthalenesulphonate and sodium-4-aminobenzenesulphonate have been identified using LC-ESI-MS for the very first time, providing direct evidence for simultaneous bond cleavage pathways (-C-N-) and (-N=N-). A new plausible mechanism of TiO2 catalysed photodegradation of Amaranth along with the comparison of its toxicity to that of its degradation intermediates and products is proposed.

J	Wang, J; Kou, LD; Zhao, L; Duan, WJ				Jing Wang; Kou, Lidong; Zhao, Liang; Duan, Wenjie			One-pot fabrication of sludge-derived magnetic Fe,N-codoped carbon catalysts for peroxymonosulfate-induced elimination of phenolic contaminants	CHEMOSPHERE												The use of waste sludge as a precursor of catalysts for environmental applications has been encouraged during the past few years. In this study, a series of magnetic Fe,N-codoped carbon catalysts (UBC-x) were successfully prepared by a facile one-pot pyrolysis method using Fe-rich sludge and N-rich urea as the raw materials. By carefully controlling the mass ratio of urea/dry sludge (x = 0-3), a significant amount of N (1-10 mass%) were incorporated, and the UBC-x catalysts, especially UBC-0.5 and UBC-0.75, could be imparted with high catalytic activity, convenient magnetic separation and high recycle stability. Phenolic contaminants like phenol and bisphenol A (BPA) could be nearly completely removed through peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-induced degradation by using UBC-x as the catalysts under a wide pH range (2 -11) and with the co-existence of water constituents (chloride Cl- and sodium humate NaH, 0-50 mM). Among the several reactive oxidative species (ROS), singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) was deemed as the main reactive species responsible for BPA degradation. Both Fe and N active sites contributed to the high catalytic activity of UBC-x, and their coordination made the catalysts rather stable with no significant Fe leaching under a wide pH range. Therefore, after an easy magnetic separation, the UBC-x could be recycled and reused efficiently in another BPA removal cycle. The as-synthesized magnetic Fe,N-codoped carbon catalysts provided a new route for sludge reutilization and showed potential applications in wastewater treatment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Phosphate functionalization was performed on the resultant nanocomposite to obtain a strong acid catalyst with bimodal pores. The synthesized materials were thoroughly characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD); Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR); N2 physisorption; field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM); acid titration; energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping; high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM); X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); 13C, 29Si, and 31P solid-state magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR); and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. The well-ordered mesopores facilitate the entrance and fast transport of molecules during reaction. The catalytic efficiency of the materials was tested for solventless glycerol carbonylation with urea and glycerol esterification involving acetic acid. The efficient catalytic performance could be associated to the higher acidity and better communicating hierarchically organized porous channels. The catalyst showed good reusability for both the reactions without any significant leaching. Therefore, the specified methodology here provides a useful pathway for the eco-friendly and effective preparation of hierarchically mesoporous carbon-silica composites and alteration of their physicochemical properties. This study opens new avenues for the development of sustainable, robust materials in rapid and facile conversion of biorenewable glycerol to fine chemicals.

We previously showed that endogenous lipid electrophiles adduct within the catalytic domain, inhibiting sEH to lower blood pressure in angiotensin II-induced hypertensive mice. As angiotensin II increases vascular H2O2, we explored sEH redox regulation by this oxidant and how this integrates with inhibition by lipid electrophiles to regulate vasotone. Kinetics analyses revealed that H2O2 not only increased the specific activity of sEH but increased its affinity for substrate and increased its catalytic efficiency. This oxidative activation was mediated by formation of an intra-disulfide bond between C262 and C264, as determined by mass spectrometry and substantiated by biotin-phenylarsinate and thioredoxin-trapping mutant assays. C262S/264S sEH mutants were resistant to peroxide-induced activation, corroborating the disulfide-activation mechanism. The physiological impact of sEH redox state was determined in isolated arteries and the effect of the pro-oxidant vasopressor angiotensin II on arterial sEH redox state and vasodilatory EETs indexed in mice. Angiotensin II induced the activating intra-disulfide in sEH, causing a decrease in plasma EET/DHET ratios that is consistent with the pressor response to this hormone. Although sEH C262-C264 disulfide formation enhances hydrolysis of vasodilatory EETs, this modification also sensitized sEH to inhibition by lipid electrophiles. This explains why angiotensin II decreases EETs and increases blood pressure, but when lipid electrophiles are also present, that EETs are increased and blood pressure lowered.

These nanocomposite materials are then utilized as catalyst supports in iron-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) for the production of liquid fuels. Experimental results indicate that Fe/CNTs-K-190 (iron catalyst supported on the CNTs treated with KMnO4 at 190 degrees C) and Fe/CNTs-KU-190 (iron catalyst supported on the CNTs treated with KMnO4 and urea at 190 degrees C) display higher FTS activity than the Fe/CNTs-K-110 (iron catalyst supported on CNTs treated with KMnO4 at 110 degrees C) and Fe/CNTs-KU-110 (iron catalyst supported on CNTs treated with KMnO4 and urea at 110 degrees C). This might be due to the weak metal-support interaction and high MnO content, and the poorer stability than Fe/CNTs-K-110 and Fe/CNTs-KU-110 catalysts with nanosheet morphology might be related to the structural collapse of the nanocubes or nanorods due to MnO evolution during the FTS process. The CNTs-MnOx nanocomposite-supported iron FTS catalysts in particular display unparalleled high C5+ selectivity (over 90%) and very low CH4 selectivity (below 4.6%). The unique CNTs-MnOx nanocomposites may open a new window for the understanding, design, synthesis, and optimization of iron catalysts toward high-efficiency transport fuel production.					lv, jing/KIG-5276-2024; Ma, Xinbin/B-3164-2008	Ma, Xinbin/0000-0002-2210-0518													2194-4288	2194-4296				SEP	2017	5	9					1517	1521		10.1002/ente.201700060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ente.201700060													WOS:000410137900003

Synthesis and characterization of MoSe2 nanoscrolls via pulsed laser ablation in deep eutectic solvents	NANOSCALE												There is ongoing interest in the rapid, reproducible production of 2-dimensional (2-D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), such as molybdenum-based TMD (MoX2), where X is a chalcogen atom such as sulphur (S), selenium (Se) or tellurium (Te), driven by their unique optical and electronic properties. Once fabricated into an atomically thin layer structure, these materials have a direct-indirect bandgap transition, strong spin-orbit coupling, and favourable electronic and mechanical strain-dependent properties which are attractive for electronics. Pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) is an economic, green alternative for synthesis of TMD. It has been shown that in the case of MoX2, the chemical processes during the plasma phase of the ablation can yield the formation of multispecies, including MoOx quantum dots when oxygen-containing solvents are used. Here, we introduce the formation of MoSe2 nanoscrolls with low oxygen content synthesized via pulsed laser ablation in deep eutectic solvents (PLADES). Our results suggest that the synthesis produces a stable colloidal solution of large 2-D structures with tuneable surface charge by replacing the deep eutectic solvent (DES) with DI water. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) results suggest that irradiating the solvent at near infrared NIR energy does not affect its chemical composition. NMR also proves that serial washing can completely remove solvent from the nanostructures. Raman shifts suggest the formation of large, thin MoSe2 nanosheets aided by the solvent confinement resulting from van der Waal forces and hydrogen bonds interactions between MoSe2 and urea. Binding energies measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirm MoSe2-DES preference to form 1T-MoSe(2)versus molybdenum oxides and 2H MoSe2 in DI-water. Raman and XPS findings were validated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Results of this work validate the use of PLADES for the synthesis of stable, crystalline, low-surface-oxygen-content colloidal MoSe2 nanoscrolls in scalable quantities.

A systematic multi-omics analysis of GH effects in the liver has not been performed. GH receptor (GHR) deficiency is a unique model for studying the consequences of lacking GH action. In this study, we used molecular profiling techniques to capture a broad spectrum of these effects in the liver of a clinically relevant large animal model for Laron syndrome. Methods: We performed holistic proteome and targeted metabolome analyses of liver samples from 6-month-old GHR-deficient (GHR-KO) pigs and GHR-expressing controls (four males, four females per group). Results: GHR deficiency resulted in an increased abundance of enzymes involved in amino acid degradation, in the urea cycle, and in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. A decreased ratio of long-chain acylcarnitines to free carnitine suggested reduced activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A and thus reduced mitochondrial import of fatty acids for beta-oxidation. Increased levels of short-chain acylcarnitines in the liver and in the circulation of GHR-KO pigs may result from impaired beta-oxidation of short-chain fatty acids or from increased degradation of specific amino acids. The concentration of mono-unsaturated glycerophosphocholines was significantly increased in the liver of GHR-KO pigs without morphological signs of steatosis, although the abundances of several proteins functionally linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (fetuin B, retinol binding protein 4, several mitochondrial proteins) were increased. Moreover, GHR-deficient liver samples revealed distinct changes in the methionine and glutathione metabolic pathways, in particular, a significantly increased level of glycine N-methyltransferase and increased levels of total and free glutathione. Several proteins revealed a sex-related abundance difference in the control group but not in the GHR-KO group. Conclusions: Our integrated proteomics/targeted metabolomics study of GHR-deficient and control liver samples from a clinically relevant large animal model identified a spectrum of biological pathways that are significantly altered in the absence of GH action. Moreover, new insights into the role of GH in the sex-related specification of liver functions were provided. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH.

The process involves an inexpensive catalyst urea hydrogen peroxide and a base (t-BuOK) in alcohol for the transformation of 1-naphthol or 2,5-dihydroxynaphthalene to lawsone or its derivatives in the presences of oxygen. The process is further directed to produce lawsone or its derivatives, with no extraneous heating to make it energetically efficient. The synthesized compounds are analyzed by FT-IR, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectral studies. Materials and Methods: All the raw materials were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as such without further purification. The infrared spectra were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet-Avatar-330 FT-IR spectrophotometer using KBr (pellets) and noteworthy absorption values (cm(-1)) are obtained. H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra are recorded at 293K on BRUKER AMX-400 Spectrometer operating with the frequencies of 300 MHz and 75, 125 MHz respectively using DMSO-d(6) as solvent. Results: The 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (lawsone) and 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquninone (5-hydroxylawsone) are synthesised from 1-naphthol and 1,5-dihydorxynaphalene with urea-hydrogen peroxide as the catalyst in basic medium and oxygen as the oxidizing agent. After purification, the formed products are analysed by IR and NMR spectroscopy. The yield is 82% and the purity of the products is > 95%. Conclusion: The present study highlights the process for the manufacturing of lawsone and its derivatives which is efficient in terms of energy needed for the activation of products from reactants. The advantages include its cost-effective nature in terms of simple inexpensive catalyst required for the process and high yield. The mild reaction conditions employed and the harmless by product obtained further confirm the usefulness of this synthetic process.

The IMI degradation rate was heavily dependent on Na2CO3 concentration and reaction time but only slightly on temperature, reaching 99.4% in 0.5 mol/L Na2CO3 solution with 5 g/L ZVA1 in 60 min. The degradation of IMI follows first-order kinetics. We used high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) for analyzing the transformation products, and found that IMI disintegrated into IMI urea, IMI guanidine, IMI nitrosamine, and 1-choloro-5-methcyclohea-1,4-diene.

However, synthesizing FeTiO3 nanopowder with high crystallinity and phase purity typically requires specialized equipment and controlled heat treatment due to the instability of Fe2+ ions. Using the one-step solution combustion synthesis (SCS) method, FeTiO3 nanopowder withe high crystallinity were successfully produced utilizing basic equipment. Additionally, the influence of carbon additives on phase transitions, as well as the physical and physicochemical properties of the synthesized powder, was examined. XRD results indicate that increasing the amount of fuel, particularly glycine, creates a stable environment for the crystallization of FeTiO3 nanoparticles. Moreover, enhancing the carbon content in precursor solutions with urea enhances reduction conditions and boosts the stability of FeTiO3 in the final product. The presence of carbon additives in glycine-fuel samples leads to unfavorable outcomes by increasing the levels of TiO2 and Fe3O4 undesirable phases. Incorporating additive carbon into the urea-synthesized precursor solution resulted in a particle size increase exceeding 50 nm and raised the combustion temperature by a minimum of 230 degrees C. Furthermore, the presence of 15 wt% additive carbon in the sample synthesized with glycine improved the specific surface area of particles from 2.44 m2/g to 18.41 m2/g. Obtained results have shown that achieving high crystallinity of FeTiO3 nanopowder is feasible through a one-step solution combustion synthesis process. This can be accomplished by carefully choosing the synthesis conditions, such as the type and quantity of fuel, along with the carbon additive.					khaki, Jalil/AAD-1570-2020														0272-8842	1873-3956				NOV 15	2024	50	22	C				48041	48063		10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.09.153	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.09.153		OCT 2024											WOS:001338706700001

In this regard, a carbon paste electrode (CPE) was functionalized by the nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots/tin oxide (N-CQDs/SnO2) nanocomposite and 1-butyl-2,3-dimethyl imidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C4DMIM][PF6]) ionic liquid (IL). The structure and surface morphology of the nanocomposite were characterized by various methods, including field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and x-ray diffraction (XRD). The modified electrode displayed powerful and long-lasting electron mediating activity, with well-separated NADH and folic acid oxidation peaks. The sensing response of the developed [C4DMIM][PF6]/N-CQDs/SnO2/CPE platform was evaluated by determining NADH via the voltammetric technique under the optimized operating conditions. The current peaks of the square wave voltammograms of NADH and folic acid increased linearly with enhancing its concentrations within the ranges of 0.003-275 mu M NADH and 0.4-380 mu M folic acid. The detection limits for NADH and folic acid were obtained at 0.8 nM and 0.1 mu M, respectively. Interference species such as glucose, urea, tryptophan, glycine, methionine, and vitamin B-12 had no influence on the ability of the fabricated modified electrode to detect the target species. The low detection limit, high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, superior stability, and cost-effectiveness made it suitable for the quantification of NADH in the real biological samples with the recovery percent values in the range of 97.5%-103%.

Apelin is a bioactive peptide that protects against AKI by alleviating inflammation, inhibiting apoptosis, and preventing lipid oxidation, but its role in protecting against mitochondrial damage remains unknown. Herein, we examined the protective effects of apelin on mitochondria in cisplatin-stimulated human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells and evaluated its therapeutic efficacy in cisplatin-induced AKI mice. In vitro, apelin inhibited the cisplatin-induced mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) upregulation and the fusion-promoting protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) downregulation. Apelin co-treatment reversed the decreased levels of the deacetylase, Sirt3, and the increased levels of protein acetylation in mitochondria of cisplatin-stimulated cells. Overall, apelin improved the mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential in vitro. In the AKI model, apelin administration significantly attenuated mitochondrial damage, as evidenced by longer mitochondrial profiles and increased ATP levels in the renal cortex. Suppression of MFF expression, and maintenance of Sirt3 and OPA1 expression in apelin-treated AKI mice was also observed. Finally, exogenous administration of apelin normalized the serum level of creatinine and urea nitrogen and the urine levels of NGAL and Kim-1. We also confirmed a regulatory pathway that drives mitochondrial homeostasis including PGC-1 alpha, ERR alpha and Sirt3. In conclusion, we demonstrated that apelin ameliorates renal functions by protecting tubular mitochondria through Sirt3 upregulation, which is a novel protective mechanism of apelin in AKI. These results suggest that apelin has potential renoprotective effects and may be an effective agent for AKI treatment to significantly retard CKD progression.					liu, wenhu/GXN-2105-2022; Wang, Liyan/AFI-8414-2022														0939-4451	1438-2199				AUG	2021	53	8					1229	1240		10.1007/s00726-021-03028-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-021-03028-1		JUL 2021						34254213					WOS:000672253100003

Ultrasensitive and label-free detection of creatine based on CdO nanoparticles: a real sample approach	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												Low-dimensional cadmium oxide nanoparticles (CdO NPs) were prepared by a facile wet-chemical method in an alkaline medium with reactant precursors and urea surfactants. The optical, morphological, and structural properties of CdO NPs were characterized in detail using FT-IR, UV-Vis, FESEM, XEDS, XPS, TEM and XRD techniques. A glassy carbon electrode (GCE, surface area = 0.0316 cm(2)) was fabricated with a thin-layer of CdO NPs using a conducting binder, nafion, for the development of selective and sensitive label-free creatine (Ctr) sensors. Electrochemical investigation along with determination of the sensitivity, limit of detection (LOD), linear dynamic range (LDR) and long-term stability towards Ctr was performed by an electrochemical approach. The calibration curve was found to be linear in a wide range of Crt concentrations (0.1 nM-0.1 M). The sensitivity (1.90 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2)) and LDR were calculated from the calibration curve and were also found to be linear (R-2 = 0.9297). The signal to noise ratio was similar to 3, and the LOD was calculated and found to be 50.0 +/- 0.1 pM. It is an enzyme-free organized route for the development of sensors based on low-dimensional CdO NP embedded GCE using electrochemical oxidation phenomena. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the detection of highly sensitive Ctr using a CdO NP/GCE by an I-V method. A pioneering development of Ctr sensitive sensors using CdO NPs by a facile and reliable I-V method is suggested for important sensor applications of less useful materials in biological systems.

Synthesis of further P-alkyl- and P-aryl-substituted 1,3,5-trimethyl-1,3,5-triaza-2-phosphorinan-4,6-diones	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG SECTION B-A JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL SCIENCES												The reaction of 1,5-bis(trimethylsilyl)-1,3,5-trimethylbiuret with di- and monochlorophosphanes led, with formation of Me3SiCl, to the 1,3,5-trimethyl-1,3,5-triaza-2 sigma(3)lambda(3)-phosphorinan-4,6-diones 1-4 or to the 1,5-bis-(phosphano)-1,3,5-trimethylbiuret derivatives 5 and 6, respectively. Compounds 1, 2 and 4 were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. All the heterocycles were found to display a flattened boat configuration, with the phosphorus atom and the nitrogen atom opposite to it lying out of the plane. Oxidation of the sigma(3)lambda P-3 derivatives with urea/hydrogen peroxide 1:1 adduct furnished the corresponding 2-oxo-2 sigma(4)lambda(5)-phosphorinan-4,6-diones 8-11 and the 1,5-bis(phosphoryl)-biuret derivatives 12 and 13. Spirophosphoranes 15-22 were formed in the reaction of 1-4 with tetrachloro-o-benzoquinone and of 1, 3 and 4 with hexafluoroacetone. Compounds 20 and 21 featured an oxaphosphetane ring, which was stabilized by the electronegative CF3 groups. Compound 22 was formed through the loss of the trimethylsilyl group from 21. With the exception of 21, all oxaphosphetanes were characterized through their H-1, C-13, F-19 and P-31 NMR spectra, and through electron ionization mass spectrometry. For 20, a single-crystal X-ray structure study was conducted. The coordination at phosphorus in 20 was strongly distorted trigonal bipyramidal, with the oxetane ring attached to the phosphorus at one axial and one equatorial position. The reaction of 1 with 1-trifluoromethyl-2-(heptafluoroisopropyl)-biacetyl furnished the adduct 23, rather than an oxaphosphetane such as 20.																			0932-0776	1865-7117				MAY	2015	70	5					327	342		10.1515/znb-2014-0238	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2014-0238													WOS:000355860500005

Therefore, implementation of second-tier tests (2TTs) using DBS samples has become increasingly important to avoid FPs. The most widely used 2TT metabolites include methylmalonic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, methylcitric acid, and homocysteine.Methods: We simultaneously measured 46 underivatised metabolites, including organic acids, acylglycine and acylcarnitine isomers, homocysteine, and orotic acid, in DBS samples using tandem mass spectrometry. To validate this method, we analysed samples from 147 healthy newborns, 160 patients with genetic disorders diagnosed via NBS, 20 patients with acquired vitamin B12 deficiency, 10 newborns receiving antibiotic treatment, and nine external quality control samples.Results: The validation study revealed that 31 metabolites showed good analytical performance. Furthermore, this method detected key metabolites for all diseases associated with increased levels of the following acylcarnitines: C3, C4, C5, C4DC\C5OH, and C5DC. The sensitivity of this method to detect all diseases was 100 %, and the specificity was 74-99 %, except for glutaric aciduria type 1. This method can also be used to diagnose mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation disorders (FAODs) and urea cycle defects (UCDs).Conclusions: We have described a 2TT panel of 31 metabolites in DBS samples based on an easy and rapid method without derivatisation.

Macrophages are primarily divided into pro-inflammatory M1-like and anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages based on their activation status and functions. In vitro macrophage models could be derived from mouse bone marrow cells stimulated with two types of differentiation factors: GM-CSF (GM-BMDMs) and M-CSF (M-BMDMs), to represent M1- and M2-like macrophages, respectively. Since macrophage differentiation requires coordinated metabolic reprogramming and transcriptional rewiring in order to fulfill their distinct roles, we combined both transcriptome and metabolome analysis, coupled with experimental validation, to gain insight into the metabolic status of GM- and M-BMDMs. The data revealed higher levels of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and urea and ornithine production from arginine in GM-BMDMs, and a preference for glycolysis, fatty acid storage, bile acid metabolism, and citrulline and nitric oxide (NO) production from arginine in M-BMDMs. Correlation analysis with the proteomic data showed high consistency in the mRNA and protein levels of metabolic genes. Similar results were also obtained when compared to RNA-seq data of human monocyte derived macrophages from the GEO database. Furthermore, canonical macrophage functions such as inflammatory response and phagocytosis were tightly associated with the representative metabolic pathways. In the current study, we identified the core metabolites, metabolic genes, and functional terms of the two distinct mouse macrophage populations. We also distinguished the metabolic influences of the differentiation factors GM-CSF and M-CSF, and wish to provide valuable information for in vitro macrophage studies.					zhao, guanghui/ABF-4407-2021; Yang, Jinbo/AAM-9580-2020; Zhao, Chenyang/JRX-4060-2023	Zhang, Qianyue/0009-0002-5504-0301													1664-3224					SEP 25	2023	14								1230772	10.3389/fimmu.2023.1230772	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1230772								37818352					WOS:001077547500001

A conformational change upon coordination of Ca+2 ions with their EF-hand loops leads to oxidation of substrate and emission of light. In all photoproteins, EF-hand loops I, III and IV have standard sequence for binding to Ca+2 ion, however the second one is not able for Ca+2 coordination. Sequence analysis of Mnemiopsin 2 and other known photoproteins shows that Glutamate (Glu) is occurred in the 6th position of its first EF-hand loop, but this position in other loops of mnemiopsin 2 and all functional loops of other photoproteins is occupied by Glycine (Gly). Here we designed and made single and double mutants where Gly residue at the 6th positions of loops III and IV of mnemiopsin 2 was replaced with Glu. According to the activity measurements, wild-type (WT) and G142E variants have more initial luminescence intensity than G176E and double mutants; while WT and G176E have higher values of half decay time when compared with G142E and double mutants. According to the isothermal denaturation experiments, all protein variants are structurally more stable than WT mnemiopsin 2 and that the stabilizing effects of single mutants are paired resulting in more stability of double mutant against urea denaturation. We concluded that simultaneous occurrence of Gly in the 6th position of loops III and IV is essential for evolutionary adjustment of initial intensity and decay rate of luminescence emission via affecting the interaction of the core structure of photoprotein with coelenteramide and binding affinity of Ca+2 to the corresponding loops, respectively.					jafarian, vahab/V-2078-2019; khalifeh, khosrow/N-4400-2018	Jafarian, vahab/0000-0002-8396-3894; khalifeh, khosrow/0000-0003-1758-0745; Shirdel, Akram/0000-0002-3820-8953													1011-1344	1873-2682				OCT	2018	187						18	24		10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2018.08.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2018.08.002													WOS:000447110500003

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that responds to ligands to induce or repress gene expressions, thereby regulating a diverse spectrum of biological or pathophysiologic effects. However, the effect of AhR on AKI remains unknown. A single intraperitoneal injection of 50% glycerol was performed to induce rhabdomyolysis in C57BL/6J mice. The bilateral renal pedicles were occluded for 30 minutes and then removed to stimulate renal I/R injury. 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), a photo-oxidation product of tryptophan with a high affinity for AhR, was used. The in vitro study was performed on HK-2 cells. Ferrous myoglobin and FICZ was dissolved in the medium in different cell groups. Treatment with AhR agonist FICZ significantly alleviated the elevation of serum creatinine and urea in AKI. AKI modelling-induced renal damage was attenuated by FICZ. AhR mainly expressed in proximal tubular cells and could be activated by FICZ administration. Meanwhile, AKI triggered the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in injured kidneys, while FICZ inhibited their expressions. Furthermore, FICZ effectively reversed cell apoptosis in AKI models. Mechanistically, AKI stimulated the activation of NF-kappa B and JNK pathways in the kidneys, while FICZ significantly suppressed these corresponding protein expressions. For the in vitro study, FICZ also inhibited inflammation and apoptosis in myoglobin or H/R-stimulated HK-2 cells. In summary, agonism of AhR by FICZ alleviated rhabdomyolysis and I/R-induced AKI. FICZ inhibited inflammation and apoptosis via suppressing NF-kappa B and JNK pathways in proximal tubular cells.

Oxidative stress, inflammation and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation play an important role in CsA-toxicity. Glycine (Gly) has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, Gly was investigated for its protective role against CsA-induced toxicity. CsA (20 mg/kg/day; subcutaneously) was administered to rats along with Gly injection (250 or 1000 mg/kg; intraperitoneally) for 21 days. Renal function markers [serum urea and creatinine and urinary protein and kidney injury molecule levels and creatinine clearance values] together with histopathological examinations were performed. Oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species, thiobarbutiric acid reactive substances, advanced oxidation products of protein, glutathione, ferric reducing anti-oxidant power and 4-hydroxynonenal levels), and inflammation (myeloperoxidase activity) were determined in kidney tissue. The RAS system [angiotensin II (Ang II) levels, and mRNA expressions of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II type-I receptor (AT1R)] and NADPH-oxidase 4 (NOX4) were measured in kidney and aorta. CsA caused significant disturbances in renal function markers, increases in oxidative stress and inflammation parameters and renal damage. Serum angiotensin II levels and mRNA expressions of ACE, AT1R and NOX4 elevated in the aorta and kidney of CsA-rats. Gly, especially its high-dose, alleviated renal function markers, oxidative stress, inflammation and renal damage in CsA-rats. Moreover, serum Ang II levels and mRNA expressions of ACE, AT1R and NOX4 decreased significantly in aorta and kidney in CsA-rats due to Gly treatment. Our results indicate that Gly may be useful for the prevention of CsA-induced renal and vascular toxicity.

The comprehensiveness and quality of the data that can be generated do, however, also depend on the performance provided by nano-liquid chromatography (nanoLC) separations. Proper selection of reversed-phase separation columns can be important to provide the MS instrument with peptides at the highest possible concentration and separated at the highest possible resolution. In the current contribution, we evaluate the use of the prototype generation 2 mu PAC nanoLC columns, which use C18-function-alized superficially porous micropillars as a stationary phase. When compared to traditionally used fully porous silica stationary phases, more precursors could be characterized when performing single shot data-dependent LC-MS/MS analyses of a human cell line tryptic digest. Up to 30% more protein groups and 60% more unique peptides were identified for short gradients (10 min) and limited sample amounts (10-100 ng of cell lysate digest). With LC-MS gradient times of 10, 60, 120, and 180 min, respectively, we identified 2252, 6513, 7382, and 8174 protein groups with 25, 500, 1000, and 2000 ng of the sample loaded on the column. Reduction of sample carryover to the next run (up to 2 to 3%) and decreased levels of methionine oxidation (up to 3-fold) were identified as additional figures of merit. When analyzing a disuccinimidyl dibutyric urea-crosslinked synthetic library, 29 to 59 more unique crosslinked peptides could be identified at an experimentally validated false discovery rate of 1-2%.

J	Banerjee, S; Chaturvedi, CM				Banerjee, Somanshu; Chaturvedi, Chandra Mohini			Migratory preparation associated alterations in pectoralis muscle biochemistry and proteome in Palearctic-Indian emberizid migratory finch, red-headed bunting, Emberiza bruniceps	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS												Avian migration is an exceptionally high-energy-demanding process, which is met by the accumulation and utilization of fuel stores as well as the alterations in muscle physiology prior to their flight. Pre-migratory fattening coupled with changes in flight muscle metabolic enzymes and proteome is required to provide the necessary fuel and muscle performance required for migration. We studied how the serum metabolites (urea, uric acid, and creatinine), pectoralis muscle metabolites (glycogen, glucose, and cholesterol), muscle metabolic enzymes (CPT, HOAD, CS, MDH, CCO, CK, LDH, PFK, MLPL, and PK), liver lipogenic enzyme (FAS), and pectoralis muscle proteins get altered in pre-migratory and non-migratory buntings. Significantly increased pectoralis muscle fatty add oxidation (CPT and HOAD activity), aerobic/anaerobic capacity (CS, CCO, and MDH activity), glycolytic capacity (PFK and PK activity), lipolysis (muscle LPL), and burst power (CK activity) were observed prior to the spring migration in pre-migratory buntings, whereas significantly increased pectoralis muscle anaerobic capacity (LDH activity) was observed in non-migratory buntings. Significant increase in the liver FAS showed profound lipogenesis prior to the spring migration. In this study, we have also investigated whether muscle has differential protein content during the pre-migratory and non-migratory phases of the annual migratory cycle. Twenty-nine proteins are identified and well characterized varying in expression significantly during the pre-migratory and non-migratory phases. These findings indicate that significant pre-migratory fattening and alterations in flight (pectoralis) muscle biochemistry and proteome in between the non- and pre-migratory phases may play a significant role in pre-migratory flight muscle preparation in these long-route migrants.

Folic Acid and Grape Seed Extract Prevent Azathioprine-induced Fetal Malformations and Renal Toxicity in Rats	PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH												Azathioprine (AZA) is an important drug commonly used in the therapy of the autoimmune system disorders. It induces many hazard effects that restrict its use. The present study was designed to investigate the influence of AZA on the fetal development and renal function and its co-administration with either folic acid (FA) or grape seed extract (GSE). The effects of administration of GSE or FA on AZA toxicity by gavage simultaneously for 4 weeks were studied by determining the changes in kidney histology, the glutathione level (GSH), and lipid per oxidation content as malondialdehyde in the kidney tissue. Additionally, their effects on the fetal development were investigated. Azathioprine induced a renal damage as indicated from the pronounced changes in histological structure, a significant increase in serum urea and creatinine, and malondialdehyde content in the kidney tissue. Meanwhile, the GSH activity was significantly decreased. Co-treatment with GSE significantly minimized the previously mentioned hazard effects of AZA by ameliorating the antioxidant activity. At this point, FA induced a nonsignificant protective activity. The results also revealed that administration of FA or GSE at 6th to 15th day of gestation did not altered fetal development. While, AZA administration clearly disturbed fetal development as indicated from a significant decrease in fetal weights. Furthermore, co-administration of both drugs significantly minimized similarly the hazards of AZA on the fetal development. It may be concluded that GSE and FA are a useful remedies. Maternal administrations of either both are protective agents against AZA-induced fetal malformations. Grape seed extract was more active than FA in potentiating the antioxidative defenses for controlling AZA-induced oxidative renal damages.

For the anode construction carbon nanotubes are modified with a polyaniline film onto which pyrroloquinoline quinone dependent glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH) from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus is covalently coupled. The cathode is based on bilirubin oxidase (BOD) from Myrothecium verrucaria which is coupled to a PQQ-modified carbon nanotube electrode. The resulting biofuel cell achieves power maxima of more than 100 mu W/cm(2). Galvanodynamic performance measurements in urine and saliva show a significant loss of the maximum power density compared to an EBFC in 5 mM glucose containing buffer. The EBFC achieves 12% in urine and 18% in saliva. The initial open cell potential of about 710 mV for the EBFC is reduced to 400 mV in urine and to 665 mV in saliva. To elucidate the effect of potential interfering substances in the real media the individual electrodes are investigated by cyclic voltammetry in human urine and saliva and also in the presence of urea, uric acid and ascorbic acid. Reasons for the low power output in the both body liquids are the very low glucose concentrations. In urine the cell potential is significantly decreased because of the strong influence of an oxidation process at the cathode. The low anode performance in saliva can be attributed to the diminished biochemical catalysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

FDH is a heterotrimeric membrane-bound enzyme (subunit I, II, and III) and subunit II has a C terminal hydrophobic region (CHR), which was expected to play a role in anchoring to membranes from the amino acid sequence. We have constructed a mutated FDH lacking of CHR (DchrFDH). Contrary to the expected function of CHR, DchrFDH is expressed in the membrane fraction, and subunit I/III subcomplex (DcFDH) is also expressed in a similar activity level but in the soluble fraction. In addition, the enzyme activity of the purified DchrFDH is about one twentieth of the native FDH. These results indicate that CHR is concerned with the binding between subunit I(/III) and subunit II and then with the enzyme activity. DchrFDH has clear DET activity that is larger than that expected from the solution activity, and the characteristics of the catalytic wave of DchrFDH are very similar to those of FDH. The deletion of CHR seems to increase the amounts of the enzyme with the proper orientation for the DET reaction at electrode surfaces. Gel filtration chromatography coupled with urea treatment shows that the binding in DchrFDH is stronger than that in FDH. It can be considered that the rigid binding between subunit I(/III) and II without CHR results in a conformation different from the native one, which leads to the decrease in the enzyme activity in solution.

In this study, a Tangyuan-like structure N-doped C shell Fe0 composite (Fe0@NC-0.8-0.6-800) was prepared via a "hydrothermal coating-pyrolysis reduction" strategy using glucose, ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4), and urea as raw materials to activate persulfate (PS) for organic contaminant degradation. The results revealed that Fe0@NC-0.8-0.6-800, prepared by pyrolyzing 0.8 g Fe3O4 and 0.6 g urea at 800 degrees C, removed 100% phenol within 20 min with 0.204 min-1 reaction rate constant (kobs), which was 2.4 times higher than that of Fe0@C-0.8-0-800 without N-doping (0.0866 min-1). The primary Fe0@NC-0.8-0.6-800 facilitation mechanisms include enhanced adsorption capacity, increased number of active sites on the C surface, electron transfer, and Fe2+ regeneration. Moreover, the synergistic effect between Fe0 and N defects (graphitic N and pyridinic N) in Fe0@NC-0.8-0.6-800 is the main reason for promoting non-radical pathway (1O2) generation. Based on the intermediates detected, five possible phenol degradation pathways were identified. The toxicity of phenol and degradation byproducts was evaluated by ECOSAR program. Through recycling experiments, and application in real groundwater, Fe0@NC-0.8-0.6-800 was found to show promising potential and offers a new strategy for treating organic matter-contaminated groundwater.					杨, 杨/JTT-9837-2023; Cui, Junya/GZB-1016-2022														0169-4332	1873-5584				SEP 15	2023	631								157552	10.1016/j.apsusc.2023.157552	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2023.157552		MAY 2023											WOS:001010706600001

The scheme employs nickel oxide (NiO) supported on ZrO2 as the oxygen carrier. In the process, CH4 reduces the oxidized carrier to Ni/ZrO2 in a co-current moving bed reactor, which is then oxidized back to NiO/ZrO2 by the NOx-laden flue gas in a fluidized bed reactor, completing the oxygen carrier loop. Thermodynamic studies demonstrate that the presence of CO2 does not significantly affect NOx purification performance at different flue gas flow rates. The operating temperatures of the reactors are selected based on NOx- temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) and CH4-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments. Results show that the process can optimally operate at temperatures close to the combustion plants' flue gas temperature of 400-500 degrees C, reducing the need for hot utilities. The study conducts comprehensive isothermal and autothermal analyses of the process to evaluate the effects of temperature and carrier flow rate on CH4 conversion, CO2 selectivity, carbon deposition, and NOx conversion. For the autothermal analysis, the CH4 reactor operates adiabatically, while the NOx reactor operates isothermally. Comparative studies with the conventional NOx selective catalytic reduction (SCR) process indicate an exergy efficiency and effective thermal efficiency (ETE) improvement of 9 and 18 percentage points, respectively. The findings suggest that this low-temperature chemical looping process is a promising solution for flue gas NOx treatment, utilizing cheaper natural gas as the reductant and eliminating environmental concerns, such as ammonia or urea slippage. Overall, this study contributes to the development of more efficient and sustainable methods for reducing NOx emissions.

The measurements in saliva included stress-related biomarkers (cortisol, chromogranin A, alpha-camylase, butyrylcholinesterase [BChE] and lipase [Lip]), inflammatory biomarkers (adenosine deaminase isoenzymes 1 [ADA1] and 2 [ADA2], and haptoglobin [Hp]) and oxidative stress biomarkers (cupric reducing antioxidant capacity, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, ferric reducing ability, uric acid, advanced oxidation protein products [AOPP] and hydrogen peroxide [H2O2]), as well as routine biochemistry analytes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], gamma-glutamine transferase [GGT], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], creatine kinase [CK], urea, creatinine, triglycerides, lactate, calcium and phosphorus). The main changes were observed at farrowing, with increases in biomarkers of stress (cortisol and BChE), inflammation (ADA isoenzymes and Hp) and oxidative stress (AOPP and H2O2), as well as muscle and hepatic enzymes (CK, AST, ALP, GGT and LDH). Lactate and triglycerides increased at the end of gestation and remained at high concentrations until the end of lactation. Lip was higher in gestation than at lactation. Thus, changes in biomarkers of stress, immune function, oxidative stress, hepatic and muscle integrity, and energy mobilization occur in sow saliva during pregnancy, farrowing and lactation. These changes, caused by physiological conditions, should be taken into consideration when these biomarkers are used for the evaluation of sow health and welfare. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the mechanism underlying the antifatigue effects of GSE and TR are still unclear. Hence, we investigated whether GSE and TR have synergistic effects against fatigue in mice. MATERIALS/METHODS: L6 cells were treated with different concentrations of TR and GSE, and cell viability was determined using 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium. Oxidative stress was analyzed by immunocytochemistry using MitoTrackerTM Red FM and an anti-8-oxoguanine antibody. Respiratory gas analysis was performed to investigate metabolism. Expression of an activated protein kinase was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. Gene expression of cluster of differentiation 36 and pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 4 was measured using reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction. Mice were orally administered TR, GSE, or their combination for 30 days, and then fatigue-related parameters, including lactate, blood urea nitrogen, and glycogen, were measured after forced swimming. RESULTS: TR and GSE reduced oxidative stress levels in hydrogen peroxide-stimulated L6 cells and enhanced the oxygen uptake and lipid metabolism in mice after acute exercise. After oral administration of TR or GSE for 30 days, the fatigue-related parameters did not change in mice. However, the mice administered GSE (400 mg/kg/day) alone for 30 days could swim longer than those from the other groups. Further, no synergistic effect was observed after the swimming exercise in mice treated with the TR and GSE combination for 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data suggest that TR and GSE may exert antifatigue effects in mice after acute exercise by enhancing oxygen uptake and lipid oxidation.

Firstly, PDA nanoparticles with an average size of 150 nm were synthesized through spontaneous oxidation polymerization of dopamine hydrochloride in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution at 50 degrees C for 5 h under stirring. And it was retained in aqueous dispersion. Then, isophoeone diisocyanate (IPDI), polytetrahydrofuran diol (PTMG-1000), 2,2-dimethylol propionic acid (DMPA) were reacted to prepare the hydrophilic poliurethane prepolymer at 80 degrees C for 2 h under stirring, and then PDA nanoparticles in aqueous dispersion were added into the prepolymer to emulsify simultaneously for 30 min. Finally, 1,4-butanediol (BDO) was used as a small molecule chain extender to prepare WPU/PDA composites. It was found that both the thermostability and mechanical properties of WPU is enchanted by the addition of PDA nanoparticles. Especially when the concentration of PDA nanoparticles is 0.5 wt%, the initial degradation temperature of WPU/PDA composites is enhanced by 22.7 degrees C, and the tensile strength and Young's modulus is increased by 37% and 78%, respectively, compared with pure WPU. Meanwhile, with the addition of PDA nanoparticles, the formation of cracks on the surface of WPU after ultraviolet irradiation is obviously hindered, and the decline of thermostability caused by ultraviolet irradiation is effectively suppressed. This can be mainly attributed to the impediment of the bond breakage during the ultraviolet irradiation due to the interaction of PDA nanoparticles with the urethane bonds and urea bonds of the hard segment of WPU.

Acute perioperative alterations in metabolism: A pilot study using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics	SURGERY												Objective: To characterize early physiologic stresses imposed by surgery by applying metabolomic analyses to deeply phenotype pre- and postoperative plasma and urine of patients undergoing elective surgical procedures. Background: Patients experience perioperative stress through depletion of metabolic fuels. Bowel stasis or injury might allow more microbiome-derived uremic toxins to enter the blood, while the liver and kidney are simultaneously clearing analgesic and anesthetic drugs. Metabolomics provides a broad-scale snapshot of small-molecule chemicals generated in vital energetic and detoxification pathways, enabling a Methods: We performed metabolomic analysis of paired preoperative and early-recovery plasma (n = 34) and urine (n = 35) from patients who underwent elective surgeries, spanning cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hernia, oncologic, and urologic procedures. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analyses were performed together with the analysis of select metabolites and macromolecules via conventional clinical assays. Results: Fuel stress during elective surgery manifested in changes across all major metabolic pathways, encompassing lipolysis, glycolysis-Krebs cycle, ketogenesis, and glycogenolysis. A common signature of enhanced amino acid oxidation and urea-cycle activity emerged, which was especially pronounced in patients given citrulline boluses before visceral procedures. Excretion of amino acid-derived catabolite toxins increased during surgery, notably those derived from gut microbes, as did an extract of disposable surgical plasticware, bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate. Conclusion: Elective surgery imposes broad-scale early and measurable metabolic changes. The use of citrulline-enriched preoperative carbohydrate drinks needs further study to limit metabolic burden. Attention to perioperative nutrition and intraoperative control of gut-microbial toxins might reduce metabolic derangements and lead to better postoperative outcomes. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Sodium thiosulfate improves renal function and oxygenation in L-NNA-induced hypertension in rats	KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL												Sodium thiosulfate, a reversible oxidation product of hydrogen sulfide, has vasodilating and anti-oxidative properties, making it an attractive agent to alleviate damaging effects of hypertension. In experimental settings, inhibition of nitric oxide synthase causes hypertension, renal dysfunction and damage. We hypothesized that thiosulfate would attenuate renal injury and improve renal function, hemodynamics and the efficiency of oxygen utilization for sodium reabsorption in hypertensive renal disease. Additionally, thiosulfate co-administration would further improve these variables when compared to inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system alone. Nitric oxide synthase was inhibited in Sprague Dawley rats by administering N-omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) in the food for three weeks. After one week, rats were split into two groups; without and with thiosulfate in the drinking water. In a parallel study, rats given N-omega-nitro-L-arginine and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril at a relatively low dose in their food were divided into two groups; without and with thiosulfate in the drinking water. Treatment with thiosulfate alleviated hypertension (mean 190 vs. 229 mmHg), lowered plasma urea (mean 11.3 vs. 20.0 mmol/L) and improved the terminal glomerular filtration rate (mean 503 vs. 260 mu l/min/100 gbw), effective renal plasma flow (mean 919 vs. 514 mu l/min/100 gbw) and oxygen utilization for sodium reabsorption (mean 14.3 vs. 8.6 mu mol/mu mol). Combining thiosulfate with lisinopril further lowered renal vascular resistance (mean 43 vs. 63 mmHg/ml/min/100 gbw) and prevented glomerulosclerosis. Thus, our results suggest that thiosulfate has therapeutic potential in hypertensive renal disease and might be of value when added to standard antihypertensive therapies.

J	Govardhane, S; Shende, P				Govardhane, Sharayu; Shende, Pravin			Potential of phthalocyanine on streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats: An initiative of dye in substitution of therapeutics	JOURNAL OF PORPHYRINS AND PHTHALOCYANINES												Type 1 diabetes mellitus, is one of the severe chronic metabolic diseases with severe worldwide complications due to increased levels of glucose affecting many organ functionalities. Antioxidant properties reduce the free radicals and inhibit the oxidation that promotes cellular development in many conditions such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disorders. Phthalocyanine is a large blue colored aromatic compound with high potential of anti-oxidant ability owing to the presence of porphyrazine ring units. The present study has aimed at examining the potential effect of phthalocyanine on the streptozotocin-induced diabetic model over 28 days. For the study, the animals were assigned into 4 groups: control, diabetic, phthalocyanine (10 mu g/kg/day) treated diabetic group and phthalocyanine (20 mu g/kg/day) treated diabetic group. After the induction of diabetes using streptozotocin (53 mg/kg body weight), phthalocyanine (10 mu g/kg/day) and phthalocyanine (20 mu g/kg/day) were given daily for 28 days and the blood glucose level was checked on 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th day. A significant reduction in blood glucose within the period on the 28th day with increase in body weight was observed. Phthalocyanine also showed a decrease in the total protein content and blood urea nitrogen with improved oxidative stress parameters. The histopathological analyses displayed improvement in pancreatic structure with basal rounded nuclei and well-defined boundaries normal acini with a phthalocyanine dose (10 mu g/kg). It was concluded that phthalocyanine at the dose of 10 mu g/kg presented anti-diabetic and anti-hyperlipidemic actions with protective effect to the pancreatic beta-cell within 28 days.

In this work, composites of gold nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide were synthesized on a glassy carbon electrode by using the electrodeposition method. A modified glassy carbon electrode was used as the gate electrode and assembled into the solution-gated graphene transistor device along with the graphene channel for a non-invasive glucose detection. The sensing mechanism was based on the change in current in the channel of the device caused by the addition of glucose, of which electro-oxidation on the surface of the gold nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide led to a change in equivalent gate voltage, and consequently, affected the channel carrier concentration. The self-amplification effect of transistors was utilized in our sensors, which resulted in a detection limit that was 10 times lower than those of conventional electrochemical sensors. Compared to traditional enzymatic transistor sensors, the novel solution-gated graphene transistor nonenzymatic sensors based on gold nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide demonstrated significant sensing advantages, such as a simple structure, wide linear range from 10 mu M to 400 mu M and 400 mu M to 31 mM, and low detection limit down to 4 mu M. The chemicals coexisting in human sweat e.g. sodium chloride, urea, and lactic acid imposed no distinct interference for the glucose detection. Therefore, we achieved a non-invasive detection of glucose in the artificial sweat samples with satisfactory sensing results. This work demonstrates an effective route for non-invasive glucose testing in practical clinical diagnosis by using nonenzymatic, solution-gated graphene transistor devices.

Various honey samples exhibited protective effect against drug and chemical induced toxicity. The study was designed to determine the antioxidant content and activity of carob honey and to investigate its hepato-renal protective effect in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced kidney and liver injury in rats. Material and Methods. Phenolic, flavone and flavonol in carob honey were quantified. DPPH, ABTS center dot(+), ferric reducting antioxidant power, and total antioxidant activity were used to evaluate the antioxidant activity. Rats were used for the experiment, and received either intraperitoneal injection of CCl4 (1 mL/kg.b.wt); honey (orally, 2 g/kg.b.wt) and CCl4; or honey. Liver and kidney function parameters were assessed. Oxidative parameters including lipid peroxidation (MDA), protein carbonyl formation (PCO), advanced protein oxidation products (AOPP), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), reduced glutathione (GSH), and ascorbic acid were measured in the kidney and liver tissues. Results. CCl4 caused a significant elevation of liver enzymes, lactic acid dehydrogenase, blood glucose, uric acid, blood urea and serum creatinine as compared to the control group. Also, it significantly increased MDA, PCO and AOPP level, and markedly decreased GHS, ascorbic acid, CAT and GPx in the liver and kidney tissues. These changes were significantly ameliorated by carob honey before and after CCl4 administration. Honey alone did not cause significant changes as compared to the control group. Conclusion. The data showed for the first time that carob honey has high antioxidant content, antioxidant property, and protective effect against CCl4 induced kidney and liver toxicity by maintaining the activity of antioxidant defense system.

Whether its biological mechanism is the nitritation-anammox or partial denitrification (PD)-anammox brought violent controversy between two groups. As a third party, here we uncovered the mystery of the moving-bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) as a PD-anammox process by analyzing the diversity and phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) of microbes in anoxic pond. Anammox bacteria was found in the MBBR anoxic tank, which abundance is 8.9 times of that in the common anaerobic-anoxic-oxic process, confirming the existence of anammox process. The denitrifying bacteria (DNB) content in the anoxic tank is 5.9 times of the content of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB), thus the DNB-anammox system is proved at the microbial composition level. The PICRUSt analysis found that ammonium nitrogen is mainly derived from the deamination of urea. The functional genes NAR and AMO of DNB and AOB are 910.84 and 5.80 rpms, respectively. The NAR gene content is 157.0 times of the AMO gene content and it is proved at the genetic level that the nitrite in the anoxic pool is mainly derived from denitrification. This study demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of the PD-anammox in the anammox process, which is different from the traditional nitritation-anammox demonstrated in Strass Wastewater Treatment Plant, Austria and Changi Water Reclamation Plant. Singapore and provided an alternative option for the mainstream application of anammox. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	Akkara, PJ; Sabina, EP				Akkara, Priya Josson; Sabina, Evan Prince			Pre-treatment with Beta Carotene Gives Protection Against Nephrotoxicity Induced by Bromobenzene via Modulation of Antioxidant System, Pro-inflammatory Cytokines and Pro-apoptotic Factors	APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY												Bromobenzene is an environmental toxin which causes hepatotoxicity, and the secondary metabolites on biotransformation cause nephrotoxicity. The objective of this study was to assess the alleviation of the nephrotoxic effect of bromobenzene by beta carotene in female Wistar albino rats. Beta carotene (10 mg/kg b.w.p.o.) was delivered orally to the rats for 9 days before bromobenzene (10 mM/kg b.w.p.o.) was intragastrically intubated. Kidney markers, antioxidant status and lipid peroxidation were evaluated. In addition, the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta were measured in serum and in kidney tissue homogenate using ELISA. Caspase, COX-2 and NF-kappa B were measured with the help of Western blotting. Histopathological analysis of the kidney was done for the control and experimental rats. Bromobenzene induction caused elevation in levels of creatinine, urea, uric acid, cytokines and lipid per oxidation along with deterioration in histological observations and antioxidant status. Pre-treatment with beta carotene significantly (*p < 0.05) normalised the levels of kidney markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines. It also reduced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, as shown by improved antioxidant status. The anti-apoptotic activity was evidenced by inhibition of protein expression of caspase, COX-2 and NF-kappa B. This significant reversal (*p < 0.05) of the above variations in comparison with the control group as noticed in the bromobenzene-administered rats demonstrates that beta carotene possesses promising nephroprotective effect through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activity and therefore suggests its use as a potential therapeutic agent for protection from bromobenzene and hence environmental pollutant toxicity.

Cardiovascular and renal dysfunction has been associated with fluoride toxicity. Therefore, this study investigated the mechanism of action of sodium fluoride (NaF) induced hypertension and cardiovascular complications Forty male albino rats of an average of 10 rats per group were used. Group A received clean tap water. Toxicity was induced in Group B to D by administering graded doses of NaF through drinking water ad libitum for 10 days at 150 ppm, 300 ppm, and 600 ppm concentration respectively. Following administration of NaF, there was significant increase in systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and mean arterial pressure. Markers of oxidative stress; malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, advance oxidation protein products, and protein carbonyl were significantly increased in dose-dependent pattern in the cardiac and renal tissues of rats together with significant decrease in the GST activity in NaF-treated rats compared to the control. Also serum markers of inflammation, cardiac, and renal damage including myeloperoxidase, xanthine oxidase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and Creatinine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB) significantly increased indicating induction of oxidative stress, renal, and cardiac damage after exposure. Histopathology of the kidney and heart revealed aberrations in the histological architecture in NaF-treated rats. Also, immunohistochemistry showed higher expression of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) in the cardiac and renal tissues of rats administered NaF.

Methods: Eight-week old male Wistar rats were injected with streptozotocin to induce diabetes. The effects of CCE (250 or 500 mg/kg) on renal function index, fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood fat, oxidation index, and pathological kidney changes for 3 weeks were compared to those of the positive control drug, captopril. Results: At 12 weeks, CCE (500 mg/kg) treatment had significantly decreased serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN, 12.61 +/- 1.42 mmol/L), serum creatinine (SCr, 84.64 +/- 6.37 mu mol/L), creatinine clearance (CCr, 0.88 +/- 0.10 mmol/L), interleukin-6 (IL-6, 297.56 +/- 19.62 pg/mL), urinary albumin, urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER, 11.68 +/- 0.97 mu g/min), kidney hypertrophy index (kidney weight/ body weight, 0.58 +/- 0.03%) and FBG (11.51 +/- 0.96 mmol . L-1). It significantly decreased triglyceride (TG, 0.26 +/- 0.05 mmol/L), total cholesterol (TC, 1.52 +/- 0.06 mmol/L) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c, 0.71 +/- 0.06 mmol/L ) levels and increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c, 0.65 +/- 0.05 mmol/L). CCE treatment also significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA, 16.14 +/- 1.24 nmol/mgprot) levels and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD, 95.17 +/- 4.06 U/mgprot) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx, 154.33 +/- 11.76 mmol/L) (both p < 0.05). Finally, CCE reduced the degree of glomerular basement membrane and renal tubular thickening and swelling in diabetic rats. Conclusion: CCE has a significant inhibitory effect on diabetic nephropathy-induced renal injury in rats.																			1596-5996					MAR	2016	15	3					513	519		10.4314/tjpr.v15i3.12	http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/tjpr.v15i3.12													WOS:000373385400012

The use of water as an electrolyte enhances their environmental friendliness, and the abundant and low-cost nature of zinc resources confers a significant economic edge. Manganese-based materials, utilized as cathode materials in these batteries, offer favorable electrical conductivity, high theoretical capacity, and superior stability. The paper describes the hydrothermal synthesis of magnesium- and manganese-based composite material MgCO3@MnCO3@Mn3N2, through the optimization of the amounts of magnesium nitrate and urea, as well as the hydrothermal and calcination conditions. Under the optimal synthesis conditions, the composite material achieved a high capacity of 457.8 mAh/g at the current density of 50 mA/g, with capacity of 391.5 mAh/g at the current density of 100 mA/g. Notably, even at the current density of 200 mA/g, the capacity remained above 300 mAh/g. The SEM tests reveal that the MgCO3@MnCO3@Mn3N2 composite material exhibits three-dimensional snowflake-like morphology at the microscopic level. The EDS tests indicate a very uniform distribution of manganese and magnesium elements. Both infrared and Raman spectroscopy tests detected characteristic peaks of carbonate groups. The XPS tests show that the oxidation states of Mn and Mg elements are consistent with those of MgCO3 and MnCO3. In the XRD test, data fitting analysis indicates that the predominant components of the composite material are MgCO3 and MnCO3, with a ratio approximating 5:4. The presence of a small quantity of Mn3N2 is also identified within the composite material. The composite material synthesized under this composition exhibits superior electrochemical performance.					wei, jingjing/JTV-1457-2023														0925-8388	1873-4669				DEC 15	2024	1008								176807	10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.176807	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.176807		OCT 2024											WOS:001333349400001

Using biochar as an adsorbent to purify HM-containing wastewater is effective. However, there are few studies on screening of high-efficiency modifier and comparing their adsorption capacity. Herein, three different modification methods, including heteroatomic doping (urea), alkali hydroxide (NaOH) and chemical oxidation (KMnO4), were used to improve removal ability of HMs by biochar. The difference in impregnation solution resulted in completely differences in microscopic morphology, physicochemical properties and adsorption efficiency of modified biochar. Biochar modified by KMnO4 (Mn-BC) had significantly better adsorption capacity for Cd, Pb and Ni, reaching 46.40 mg/g, 80.20 mg/g and 18.65 mg/g, respectively, compared with raw biochar and other modification biochar, which might be due to the highest surface area and pore volume, lower zeta potential and loaded MnOx onto Mn-BC surface. Chemical and monolayer adsorption was dominant during adsorption of HMs. After adsorption, HMs were detected on the Mn-BC surface in the form of carbonate, hydroxide or oxide. Mineral precipitation and cation exchange were the dominant mechanisms during adsorption, accounting for 17.4%-41.8% and 43.0%-77.2%, respectively. Moreover, according to the correlation analysis, the increase in biochar pH, pore volume and degrees of carbonization were beneficial for HM adsorption. Mn-BC could adapt to a wider pH range (pH=4-6), and its adsorption capacity would not be interfered by coexisting ions (50 mg/L). This research proved advantages of biochar with KMnO4 modification and highlighted its application in treatment of wastewater contaminated with multiple HMs.																			2213-2929	2213-3437				JUN	2024	12	3								10.1016/j.jece.2024.112691	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2024.112691		APR 2024											WOS:001224172800001

In this study, the chiral carbazole based sensor (CCS), bearing a chiral "urea-carboxylic acid" binding site was prepared. CCS was proved to be effective in the consecutive detection of Fe3+, L-tryptophan (Trp), and L-histidine (His) by naked eyes. CCS exhibits different color changes and fluorescent 'turn-off' response toward Fe3+ and Fe2+. The discrimination of these two oxidation states of iron by CCS is important to understand the iron-related biological reactions. The limit of detection for Fe3+ by CCS is 84 nM in a high water-content solution (99 % water). CCS sensor can act as a reversible fluorescence quenching sensor for Fe3+. The results of Job's plot analysis and mass spectra reveal that Fe3+ binds to CCS with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The CCS-Fe3+ complex can sense tryptophan, or histidine by a dose-dependent turn-on fluorescent response in a high water-content solution (99 % water). The mass spectra suggest the sensing of L-histidine or L-tryptophan by CCS-Fe3+ was performed with a CCS-Fe3+: amino acid binding ratio of 1:1. In comparison with other chemosensors reported in the literature, CCS can detect the L-Trp and L-His with a low limit of detection (0.31 mu M L-Trp, 7.64 mu M L-His) in a high water content environment. Furthermore, the CCS Fe3+ complex based chemosensor was successfully applied to quantify the L-tryptophan content in commercial sleep-improving capsules containing various ingredients. The measured L-tryptophan contents in two samples are close to the announced values.

Hydrothermal Synthesis of Boron Nitride Quantum Dots/Poly(Luminol) Nanocomposite for Selective Detection of Ascorbic Acid	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY												Boron nitride quantum dots (BNQDs) were synthesized hydrothermally using boric acid and urea. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis confirmed the formation of BN quantum dots with the lattice size of 0.227 nm. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) and Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopies revealed the B-N, O-H and N-H bond formation in the BNQDs and the maximum absorption wavelength at 269 nm. BNQDs exhibited strong fluorescence emission at a wavelength of 330 nm. Furthermore, BNQDs were coated onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Followed by, poly(luminol) (Plu) was electrochemically deposited onto BNQDs/GCE from 0.1 M H2SO4 containing 0.5 mM luminol in order to prepare nanocomposite (hybrid film) coated electrode with improved stability and electrochemical activity. Due to unique nature and synergetic effect between BNQDs and Poly(luminol), as-prepared hybrid Plu/BNQDs film coated GCE showed improved electrocatalytic activity for vitamin C (ascorbic acid, AA) oxidation at 0.2 V. The calibration graph was obtained from 10 to 100 mu M AA by amperometry and limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 1.107 mu M. The interference effects were also carried out in the presence of uric acid (UA), dopamine (DA) and glucose (Glu). Interestingly, UA, DA and Glu did not produce significant responses on the Plu/BNQDs/GCE which indicated good selectivity of the sensor for AA. Moreover, Plu/BNQDs/GCE based sensor showed reproducible and repeatable analytical performances. We propose that the Plu/BNQDs based hybrid film can be used as a selective sensor probe for the detection of the AA. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

Metabolic parameters in young turkeys fed diets with different inclusion levels of copper nanoparticles	POLISH JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCES												The aim of this study was to verify the hypothesis postulating that the supplementation of turkey diets with Cu nanoparticles can lower dietary inclusion levels of Cu without compromising the growth rate and antioxidant status of turkeys. The experiment was carried out on 648 one-day-old Hybrid Converter turkeys divided into 6 groups with 6 replicates per group, in a two-factorial design with 3 dietary inclusion levels of Cu (20, 10 and 2 mg/kg) and 2 dietary sources of Cu - copper sulfate (Cu-SUL) and Cu nanoparticles (Cu-NP). At 42 days of age, blood samples were collected from 2 birds per replicate (12 birds per group), after slaughter livers were collected for analyses. Blood and liver samples were assayed for: Cu, Zn, Ca, P, Mg, GLU, TP, ALB, UREA, TAG, TC, UA, ALT, AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, SOD, GPx, CAT, VIT C, FRAP, GSH+GSSG, LOOH, MDA. The results of this experiment demonstrate that a decrease in the dietary inclusion levels of Cu from 10 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg does not compromise the growth performance of turkeys, but weakens antioxidant defense mechanisms. A Cu dose of 20 mg/kg induces oxidation reactions and has a much more inhibitory effect on the antioxidant defense system than dietary Cu content of 2 mg/kg. In turkeys, dietary supplementation with Cu-NP has a more beneficial effect on carbohydrate metabolism and antioxidant status compared with Cu-SUL. The results of analyses examining the antioxidant and metabolic status of young turkeys indicate that 10 mg/kg is the optimal dietary inclusion level of Cu.

In addition, CeO2-TA(10) obtained at the suitable TA/Ce molar ratio of 10 presents the superior NH3-SCR activity in a broad temperature window. The introduction of thiourea promotes the formation of cubic CeO2 nanocubes in catalyst, but not the nanoparticles formed in CeO2(w/o) and CeO2-UA(10). Furthermore, the cubic CeO2 nanocubes mainly expose the crystal faces of {100}, which is helpful to the formation of more oxygen vacancies on the surface of CeO2-TA(10). At the same time, the formation of the specific sulfate species (CeOSO4) is also promoted under the influence of thiourea, thus simultaneously tunes the surface acidity of CeO2(w/o) by enhancing the Bronsted acid sites, although its Lewis acid sites are significantly decreased due to the diminution of the BET surface area. Compared with urea, the using of thiourea as the structure-directing agent also adjusts the physical-chemical properties of CeO2(w/o) and promotes its chemisorbed oxygen concentration. The results presented herein give a new thought for the development of state-of-the-art cerium-based catalysts for the NH3-SCR reaction.

However, the behavior of monometallic nanoparticles as electrochemical creatinine sensors showed limitations concerning the current density in the mA/cm(2) range and wide detection window, which are essential parameters for the development of a sensor for POC applications. Herein, we report a new sensor, a reduced graphene oxide stabilized binary copper-iron oxide-based nanocomposite on a 3D printed Ag-electrode (Fe-Cu-rGO@Ag) for detecting a wide range of blood creatinine (0.01 to 1000 mu M; detection limit 10 nM) in an electrochemical chip with a current density ranging between 0.185 and 1.371 mA/cm(2) and sensitivity limit of 1.1 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2) at physiological pH. Interference studies confirmed that the sensor exhibited no interference from analytes like uric acid, urea, dopamine, and glutathione. The sensor response was also evaluated to detect creatinine in human blood samples with high accuracy in less than a minute. The sensing mechanism suggested that the synergistic effects of Cu and iron oxide nanoparticles played an essential role in the efficient sensing where Fe atoms act as active sites for creatinine oxidation through the secondary amine nitrogen, and Cu nanoparticles acted as an excellent electron-transfer mediator through rGO. The rapid sensor fabrication procedure, mA/cm(2) peak current density, a wide range of detection limits, low contact resistance including high selectivity, excellent linear response (R-2 = 0.991), and reusability ensured the application of advanced electrochemical sensor toward the POC creatinine detection.

The effects of different dopant concentrations were investigated. The modified TiO2 catalysts were characterized for phase composition, surface morphology, specific surface area, degree of doping, charge states and bandgap energy combining various techniques. The results showed that controlled iron and nitrogen concentrations significantly altered the physicochemical properties of the catalysts. The photocatalysts displayed the anatase/rutile/brookite crystal phase mixture. The rutile and brookite phase contents increased with increasing iron content. On the other hand, increasing nitrogen content inhibited the formation of rutile and brookite phases and the catalysts displayed predominantly the anatase phase. High iron and low nitrogen contents led to the highest BET surface areas. The surface morphology changed from nanorice to spherical shape with increasing iron content. The bandgap energy of all Fe-N-TiO2 samples was in the range 2.7-3.1 eV, being lower than that of undoped TiO2 and pure anatase phase. Nitrogen was incorporated into the TiO2 lattice on interstitial positions (Ti-O-N). The iron, substituting some Ti4+ in the lattice was presented in Fe2+ and Fe+ oxidation state, as confirmed by XANES measurements. The photocatalytic degradation of antibiotic ciprofloxacin was performed under visible light using a LED illumination source and nearly 70 % of the antibiotic was removed in 6 h by using the most active sample (2.5 %N-1.5 %Fe). As verified by photoluminescence results, the iron and nitrogen dopants synergistically enhanced the charge separation, since they promoted the formation of the different TiO2 phases.

A post-sulfonated one-pot synthesized magnetic cellulose nanocomposite for Knoevenagel and Thorpe-Ziegler reactions	RSC ADVANCES												The development of biodegradable and active cellulosic-based heterogeneous catalysts for the synthesis of different organic compounds would be attractive in pharmaceutical and petrochemical-related industries. Herein, a post-sulfonated composite of one-pot synthesized magnetite (Fe3O4) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) was used as an effective and easily separable heterogeneous catalyst for activating the Knoevenagel and Thorpe-Ziegler reactions. The composite was developed hydrothermally from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), iron chlorides, urea, and hydrochloric acid at 180 & DEG;C for 20 h in a one-pot reaction. After collecting the magnetic CNCs (MCNCs), post-sulfonation was performed using chlorosulfonic acid (ClSO3H) in DMF at room temperature producing sulfonated MCNCs (SMCNCs). The results confirmed the presence of sulfonated Fe3O4 and CNCs with a hydrodynamic size of 391 nm (& PLUSMN;25). The presence of cellulose was beneficial for preventing Fe3O4 oxidation or the formation of agglomerations without requiring the presence of capping agents, organic solvents, or an inert environment. The SMCNC catalyst was applied to activate the Knoevenagel condensation and the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction with determining the optimal reaction conditions. The presence of the SMCNC catalyst facilitated these transformations under green procedures, which enabled us to synthesize a new series of olefins and thienopyridines, and the yields of some isolated olefins and thienopyridines were up to 99% and 95%, respectively. Besides, the catalyst was stable for five cycles without a significant decrease in its reactivity, and the mechanistic routes of both reactions on the SMCNCs were postulated.

Advanced glycosylation end products as metabolic predictors of systemic pro-inflammatory and prooxidant status in patients with end-stage renal disease	CYTOKINE												Controlling systemic proinflammatory and prooxidant effectors is essential for mitigating cardiovascular risk and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, monitoring these processes is still chal-lenging due to the high uncertainty about their determinants and predictors. Thus, we investigated the rela-tionship between advanced glycosylation end products (AGE), proinflammatory and prooxidant effectors in ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). In addition to nutritional profile and dialysis efficiency, AGE, cytokines, chemokines, C-reactive protein (CRP), total (TAC) and non-protein (npAC) antioxidant capacity, lipid and protein oxidation were analyzed in blood samples from 43 HD patients. AGE, CRP, cytokines, chemokines, protein carbonyl (PCn), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were upregulated, while TAC and npAC were down -regulated in HD patients compared to heath subjects. Dialysis efficiency, TAC and npAC were reduced, while leucocytes counting, pre-and post-HD urea, TNF, IL-6, IL-10, CCL-2, MIP-1 & beta;, PCn, and MDA were increased in patients with higher AGE accumulation compared to those with lower AGE levels. Serum levels of CRP, protein carbonyl, malondialdehyde, and all cytokines and chemokines analyzed were correlated with AGE circulating levels for patients with higher AGE accumulation. AGE was inversely correlated with IL-10, TAC and npAC in patients with higher AGE accumulation. AGE exhibited predictive value (determination coefficient) to explain CRP, cytokines, chemokines, PCN, MDA, TAC and npAC variability in patients with higher AGE levels. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that AGE accumulation is associated with important proinflammatory and prooxidant effectors in patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis. Thus, AGE monitoring may be relevant to predict systemic inflammatory stress and the balance between oxidant and antioxidant status in these patients.

Chemopreventive effect of riboflavin on the potassium bromate-induced renal toxicity in vivo	NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY												Potassium bromate (PB) is a general food additive, flavor enhancer, a by-product of water disinfection, and a class 2 carcinogen. It exerts various toxic effects in a dose- and time-dependent manner in vivo. This study is to explore the chemopreventive efficacy of vitamin B-2(riboflavin, RF) in PB-administered Swiss albino rats. The rats were distributed into five groups: control (group 1), PB alone (group 2, 150 mg/kg), RF alone (group 3, 2 mg/kg), PB + RF1 (group 4, 150 and 2 mg/kg), and PB + RF2 (group 5, 150 and 4 mg/kg). All the rodents were sacrificed after the completion of the treatment cycle. Then, blood and kidney samples were subjected to biochemical analysis. Group 2 demonstrated vivid signs of renal toxicities evidenced by altered renal function markers (urea, creatinine, albumin, glutathione-S-transferase) and redox status parameters (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, reduced glutathione, lipid, and protein oxidation products). However, group 3 exhibited a slight alteration in many of the parameters while groups 4 and 5 demonstrated dose-dependent chemopreventive efficiency of RF against PB-induced alterations. Besides, RF seemed to facilitate apoptosis as well as inhibition of the necrosis in the PB-pre-challenged groups, as demonstrated by the cleaved PARP and lactate dehydrogenase activity. Also, the histopathological analysis and comet assay validate the biochemical results of the treatment groups significantly. All these results plead that RF has a significant chemopreventive property against PB-induced toxicity in vivo. Therefore, RF is a suitable agent in preventing the PB-induced toxicities at the clinical and industrial levels.

Polyaniline/MWCNTs/starch modified carbon paste electrode for non-enzymatic detection of cholesterol: application to real sample (cow milk)	ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Nanocomposite materials are potentially revolutionizing many technologies, including sensors. In this paper, we described the application of "PANI/MWCNTs/Starch" modified carbon paste electrode (PCS-CPE) as a simple and highly sensitive cholesterol sensor. This novel nano-composite material has integrated nano-morphology, where polyaniline could interact effectively with the additives; pi-pi stacking "MWCNTs," and covalently bonded with starch. Specific binding sites (sugar chains), better electro-catalytic properties and fast electron transfer facilitated the oxidation of cholesterol. Fourier transform infrared spectra confirmed the interaction of cholesterol with the composite material. The sensing response of PCS was measured by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry (0.1 M PBS-5 used as supporting electrolyte). As the amount of cholesterol increased in the test solution, cyclic voltammograms showed a rise of peak current (cathodic and anodic). Under the normal experimental conditions, the developed sensor exhibited wide linear dynamic range (0.032 to 5 mM) (upper limit is due to lack of solubility of cholesterol), high sensitivity (800 mu AmM-1 cm(-2)), low detection limit (0.01 mM) and shorter response time (within 4-6 s). Analytical specificity, selectivity, and sensitivity during cholesterol estimation were compared with the response of some other analytes (ascorbic acid, glucose, l-dopa, urea and lactic acid). This novel sensor was successfully applied to estimate cholesterol in cow milk (used as a model real sample). The sensing platform is highly sensitive and shows a linear response towards cholesterol without using any additional redox mediator or enzyme, thus this material is extremely promising for the realization of a low-cost integrated cholesterol sensor device.

By this strategy, urea and Fe(II) were utilized as alkali precursor and iron source, respectively. Structure of the as fabricated Fe 3 O 4-PRGO was elaborately inspected via both experimental and theoretical methods. In the experimental level, characterizations including TGA-DTA, BET-BJH, FTIR, UV-Vis, Raman, XPS were conducted to analyze the hybrid structure. In the theoretical level, methodology of equilibrium thermodynamics was employed to elucidate the spontaneous formation of Fe 3 O 4 . Result shows, spontaneous formation of Fe 3 O 4 with average diameter 6.49 nm, partial reduction of graphene oxide and oxidation of Fe 2 + simultaneously occur during hybrid fabrication. Combination of the two components in the hybrid is probably owing to the interaction between Fe-O and C-O moieties based on the flow of lone pair electrons. Introduction of Fe 3 O 4 improves the thermal stability of the oxygenous groups in the original graphene oxide. Moreover, owing to its near superparamagnetic feature, Fe 3 O 4-PRGO can be facilely recovered from aqueous solution by a permanent magnet. Whereby, Fe 3 O 4-PRGO exhibits high adsorptive efficiency for Cr(VI), Congo red and methyl violet in five consecutive cycles. Explorations of this work may enrich the fabrication chemistry and structural knowledge of Fe 3 O 4-graphene oxide architecture.																			2468-0230					AUG	2024	51								104804	10.1016/j.surfin.2024.104804	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.surfin.2024.104804		JUL 2024											WOS:001273260300001

Basil seed mucilage (BSM) was served as reducing, capping, and stabilizing agents in the synthesis of CuO NPs. The prepared MWCNT/CuO nanocomposite was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical methods. The FTIR results indicated that the nanocomposite surface was covered by BSM. The FESEM results show that the CuO NPs with an average particle size lower than 10 nm have been well distributed on the walls of the MWCNT. The electrochemical behavior of the nanocomposite was explored by studying the electrocatalytic behavior of the screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) modified by the nanocomposite (SPCE-MWCNT/CuO) toward the glucose oxidation. In the optimum conditions, the electrode indicated a wide linear response from 5.0 to 620.0 mu M with regression coefficients of 0.992, the sensitivity of 1050 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.7 mu M, and a reproducibility with relative standard deviation (RSD) variations from 3.5 to 11% for three measurements at each point. The obtained results also showed good selectivity to glucose against interfering species such as lactate (LA), L-ascorbic acid (AA), and urea (U) due to the use of the negatively charged BSM in the form of a coating on the nanocomposite surface. The applicability of the sensor was successfully verified by the determination of glucose concentration in artificial tears with a certain amount of glucose.

Little is known about the dynamic response of ammonia-oxidizers to different fertilization regimes in a wheat-rice rotation system. Here, we examined ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) communities across eight representative stages of wheat and rice growth and under four fertilization regimes: no nitrogen fertilization (NNF), chemical fertilization (CF), organic-inorganic mixed fertilizer (OIMF) and organic fertilization (OF). The abundance and composition of ammonia oxidizers were analyzed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of their amoA genes. Results showed that fertilization but not plant growth stages was the best predictor of soil AOB community abundance and composition. Soils fertilized with more urea-N had higher AOB abundance, while organic-N input showed little effect on AOB abundance. 109 bp T-RF (Nitrosospira Cluster 3b) and 280 bp T-RF (Nitrosospira Cluster 3c) dominated the AOB communities with opposing responses to fertilization regimes. Although the abundance and composition of the AOA community was significantly impacted by fertilization and plant growth stage, it differed from the AOB community in that there was no particular trend. In addition, across the whole wheat-rice rotation stages, results of multiple stepwise linear regression revealed that AOB played a more important role in ammonia oxidizing process than AOA. This study provided insight into the dynamic effects of fertilization strategies on the abundance and composition of ammonia-oxidizers communities, and also offered insights into the potential of managing nitrogen for sustainable agricultural productivity with respect to soil ammonia-oxidizers.

This work is the first demonstration of a NiSe2 based disposable, one time use electrochemical glucose sensor in bio-mimicking real samples wherein NiSe2 was hydrothermally grown NiSe2 on a biodegradable cellulose paper. Both physicochemical (x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscope) and electrochemical (impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV)) characterization techniques confirmed the growth and presence of NiSe2 on a cellulose paper. Electrochemical techniques like CV and amperometric (i-t) were utilized for the selective and sensitive oxidation of glucose. The results suggests that the proposed NiSe2 sensor is effective in a linear range of 0.1-1 mM with fast response time (3.9 s), low detection limit (24.8 +/- 0.1 mu M) and high sensitivity (0.25 A M-1 cm(-2)) at a potential applied (E-app = 0.55 V versus Ag vertical bar AgCl). Prior to the real sample analyses i.e. glucose detection in human urine, the fabricated NiSe2 sensor was tested for selectivity towards glucose in co-existing interferences (dopamine, ascorbic acid, uric acid, urea, sodium chloride, fructose, lactose and cysteine). Finally, glucose in artificial blood serum and urine samples was demonstrated with the fabricated NiSe2 sensor and the results are comparable to the conventional laboratory methods. The present methodology presents a novel possibility towards the design of next generation, affordable point-of-care devices for a broad range of clinical diagnostics.

Jegatha; Mayandi, Jeyanthinath; Sagadevan, Suresh			Synergistic effect of nano-floret CeO2/ZnO nanocomposite as an efficient photocatalyst for environmental remediation	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL												In this study, pure CeO2, ZnO, and CeO2/ZnO nanocomposite (CZ-NC) were synthesized using solution combustion method using urea as a fuel. The physical properties of the as-prepared samples were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. X-ray diffraction peak confirmed the successful fabrication and structural parameters of the nanomaterials. FTIR and Raman analyses confirmed the presence of Ce-O and Zn-O vibrational modes, respectively. The energy band gap (Eg) of CZ-NC estimated from the UV-vis spectra has narrowed to 1.88 eV, which enhanced the photocatalytic activity. The weak PL intensity peaks implied a lower charge recombination rate with maximum charge separation, facilitating more radical generation. BET analysis has confirmed the nanomaterial's large surface area and mesoporous nature. FESEM was used to investigate the surface morphologies of the nanomaterials, which displayed beautiful florets and sheet morphologies for CZ-NC. The internal structure of the nanomaterials was analyzed using HRTEM. EDAX further confirmed the purity of the nanomaterials, and homogeneous dispersion of elements was observed by EDX mapping. Antibacterial and dye-degradation experiments were conducted to understand the photocatalytic activities of the samples. The antibacterial activity of CZ-NC against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was superior to that of pure nanoparticles. Methylene blue (MB) dye was used to evaluate the degradation efficiency. The maximum degradation efficiency of 97.10 % was achieved for CZ-NC under a visible light source for 120 min. This enhanced activity can be attributed to the Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP).

Cameron; Wheeler, Benjamin; McClain, Craig James; Cave, Matt			Occupational exposures at a polyvinyl chloride production facility are associated with significant changes to the plasma metabolome	TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY												Background: Occupational vinyl chloride (VC) exposures have been associated with toxicant-associated steatohepatitis and liver cancer. Metabolomics has been used to clarify mode of action in drug-induce dliver injury but has not been performed following VC exposures. Methods: Plasma samples from 17 highly exposed VC workers without liver cancer and 27 unexposed healthy volunteers were obtained for metabolite extraction and GC/MS and LC/MS2 analysis. Following ion identification/quantification, Ingenuity pathway analysis was performed. Results: 613 unique named metabolites were identified. Of these, 189 metabolites were increased in the VC exposure group while 94 metabolites were decreased. Random Forest analysis indicated that the metabolite signature could separate the groups with 94% accuracy. VC exposures were associated with increased long chain (including arachidonic acid) and essential (including linoleic acid) fatty acids. Occupational exposure increased lipid peroxidation products including monohydroxy fatty acids (including 13-HODE); fatty acid dicarboxylates; and oxidized arachidonic acid products (including 5,9, and 15-HETE). Carnitine and camitine esters were decreased, suggesting peroxisomal/mitochondrial dysfunction and alternate modes of lipid oxidation. Differentially regulated metabolites were shown to interact with extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), Akt, AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The top canonical pathways affected by occupational exposure included tRNA charging, nucleotide degradation, amino acid synthesis/degradation and urea cycle. Methionine and homocysteine was increased with decreased cysteine, suggesting altered 1-carbon metabolism. Conclusions: Occupational exposure generated a distinct plasma metabolome with markedly altered lipid and amino acid metabolites. ERK1/2, Akt, AMPK, and NMDA were identified as protein targets for vinyl chloride toxicity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

J	Khan, AY; Noronha, SB; Bandyopadhyaya, R				Khan, Anees Y.; Noronha, Santosh B.; Bandyopadhyaya, Rajdip			Superior performance of a carbon-paste electrode based glucose biosensor containing glucose oxidase enzyme in mesoporous silica powder	ADVANCED POWDER TECHNOLOGY												A carbon paste electrode (CPE) based glucose biosensor was developed with an optimized composition. It had 60 wt.% graphitic carbon powder mixed with 15 wt.% silicone oil binder, to which was added 2.3 wt.% glucose oxidase (GOD) enzyme (the sensing molecule) immobilized in 12.7 wt.% mesoporous silica (SBA-15) host particles, and 10 wt.% ferrocene, as an electron mediator. Optimization was achieved by first fixing the SBA-15 content in the CPE based on detection of hydrogen peroxide, an intermediate formed during oxidation of glucose by GOD. Subsequent glucose sensing measurements necessitated addition of ferrocene to improve sensitivity. This sensor gave a very high linear sensing-range of glucose (2.0-18.2 mM) from the hypo- to hyperglycemic range, a high sensitivity (1.5 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1)), a fast response time (<5 s), a good storage stability (of at least 8 days), without any loss in sensitivity. The sensor is also selective against interfering species such as urea and dopamine, but not against uric acid and ascorbic acid. A large mesopore diameter (11.4 nm) of the SBA-15 particles ensured GOD molecule was well impregnated, translating into a superior linear range and storage stability. Simultaneously, the high specific surface area of SBA-15 (406 m(2)/g) resulted in a large contact area between carbon and SBA-15 particles, leading to increased inter-particle connectivity. The latter, together with ferrocene, resulted in increased sensitivity. (C) 2015 The Society of Powder Technology japan. Published by Elsevier B.V. and The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

Although Pauling electronegativity is the primary deciding factor for the direction of charge transfer, we report an unorthodox intra-lattice 'inverse' charge transfer from Mo to Ni in two systems, Ni73Mo alloy electrodeposited on Cu nanowires and NiMo-hydroxide (Ni : Mo = 5 : 1) on Ni foam. The inverse charge transfer deciphered by X-ray absorption fine structure studies and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy has been understood by the Bader charge and projected density of state analyses. The undercoordinated Mo-center pushes the Mo 4d-orbitals close to the Fermi energy in the valence band region while Ni 3d-orbitals lie in the conduction band. Since electrons are donated from the electron-rich Mo-center to the electron-poor Ni-center, the inverse charge transfer effect navigates the Mo-center to become positively charged and vice versa. The reverse charge distribution in Ni73Mo accelerates the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline and acidic media with 0.35 and 0.07 s(-1) turnover frequency at -33 +/- 10 and -54 +/- 8 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively. The corresponding mass activities are 10.5 +/- 2 and 2.9 +/- 0.3 A g(-1) at 100, and 54 mV overpotential, respectively. Anodic potential oxidizes the Ni-center of NiMo-hydroxide for alkaline water oxidation with 0.43 O-2 s(-1) turnover frequency at 290 mV overpotential. This extremely durable homologous couple achieves water and urea splitting with cell voltages of 1.48 +/- 0.02 and 1.32 +/- 0.02 V, respectively, at 10 mA cm(-2).

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus sakei MJM60958 (MJM60958) on NAFLD in vitro and in vivo. In in vitro tests, MJM60958 significantly inhibited lipid accumulation by 46.79% in HepG2 cells stimulated with oleic acid and cholesterol (OA-C). Moreover, MJM60958 showed safe and probiotic characteristics in vitro. In the animal study, MJM60958 administration in a high-fat diet-induced NAFLD mouse model significantly reduced body weight and liver weight, and controlled aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), triglyceride (TG), urea nitrogen (BUN), and uric acid (UA) levels in the blood, which are features of NAFLD. Further, treatment with MJM60958 also reduced steatosis scores in liver tissues, serum leptin and interleukin, and increased serum adiponectin content. Moreover, administration of MJM60958 resulted in a significantly decreased expression of some genes and proteins which are related to lipid accumulation, such as fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), and also upregulated genes and protein expression of lipid oxidation such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1A). Administration of MJM60958 increased the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa such as Verrucomicrobia, which are abundant in non-NAFLD mice, and reduced Firmicutes, which are a major group in NAFLD mice. MJM60958 affected the modulation of gut microbiota and altered the strain profile of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production in the cecum by reduced lactic acid and enhanced acetic acid production. Overall, MJM60958 showed potential as a probiotic that can prevent and treat NAFLD.					suh, */HRA-0278-2023	Cheng, Jinhua/0000-0001-6172-6882; Nguyen, Huong Thi/0000-0002-9829-0290													1661-6596	1422-0067				NOV	2022	23	21							13436	10.3390/ijms232113436	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms232113436								36362221					WOS:000881089000001

Then, the oxidation of glucose catalyzed by GOx or the hydrolyzation of urea aroused by urease can result in a generation of acidic or alkaline environment owing to the generated gluconic acid or ammonia. Herein, protonation and deprotonation interaction in TdT-yielded C-rich DNA can lead to different electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) toward Fe(CN)(6)(3- /4-). Based on it, the EIS response changes proportionally toward GOx concentrations from 0.01 to 20 U/L or urease concentrations from 0.01 to 50 U/L, and the detection limit of GOx or urease is 0.0061 U/L or 0.0028 U/L (S/N = 3), respectively. Beyond this, we also construct a series of molecular logic gates (YES, AND, NOT, and NAND) with good performance by altering inputs under long C-rich DNA substrate. These excellent properties indicate that the unique sensing platform is potential to monitor GOx or urease in practical biosystems and clinical medical examinations.

Some management practices, such as the use of nitrification inhibitors or more efficient irrigation techniques (e.g., drip irrigation), have been suggested as effective alternatives to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions released from soils amended with synthetic and organic fertilizers. In this experiment, we aimed to assess the effect of different organic amendments derived from pig manure (control without N fertilization (C); liquid fraction of pig slurry (LFPS); pig urine with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4 dimethylpyrazolephosphate (DMPP) (LFPSI); compost from the solid phase of pig slurry (COM)) compared to urea (U) and two different irrigation systems (the widespread sprinkler and alternative drip irrigation systems) on greenhouse gas (N2O, methane, CH4, and carbon dioxide, CO2) and NO emissions in a maize (Zea mays L.) crop. The effect of these treatments on crop yields and yield scaled N2O emissions were also evaluated. The use of DMPP with LFPS was an effective practice to reduce N2O and NO losses (40 and 32% mitigation, respectively, compared to LFPS alone), and was also associated with the highest rates of CH4 oxidation. Drip irrigation significantly reduced the global warming potential (in spite of a lower CH4 sink) but increased the NO losses by 58%, as opposed td sprinkler irrigation. The higher biomass production and similar grain yields observed with drip irrigatioh resulted in lower yield scaled N2O emissions in this treatment than in sprinkler irrigation. The use of organic fertilizers penalized grain yields compared to U (16-33%), although the differences were not significant in the case of LFPSI. Consequently, LFPSI in drip irrigation was (together with U applied by drip-fertigation) the treatment that led to the lowest yield-scaled N2O emissions. The use of organic N sources in irrigated maize is an environmentally advisable strategy in Mediterranean cropping systems, but an optimum balance between N oxides and greenhouse gas losses, N efficiency and crop yields requires the use of nitrification inhibitors (e.g., DMPP) with liquid organic sources.

Morphological and structural analysis of the hydrogel shows uniformly sized spines and spindle-shaped particles of the Fe/Co-MOF, and it has a high surface area (132.306 m(2) g(-1)) and porosity (0.059 cm(3) g(-1)) as confirmed by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) studies. The integration of the bimetallic MOF into a polyvinyl alcohol/chitosan (PVA/CS)-mixed matrix resulted in a multiple network hydrogel. The optimisation study investigated the effects of different pH of the PBS electrolyte, scan rates, and accumulation time in voltammetry. The electrochemical methods such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), square wave voltammetry (SWV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) provided information on the redox behaviour, electrochemical stability, and catalytic activity of the hydrogel. The sensor demonstrates a wide linear detection range from 0.05 mu M to 100 mM, a superior sensitivity of 0.02 mA mM(-1) cm(-2), and a lower limit of detection of 0.01 mu M . Active sites distributed over the hydrogel surface, specifically Fe2+ and Co2+ within the MOF structure, catalyse the oxidation of l-lactic acid, resulting in electron transfer and the formation of pyruvic acid. Notably, the fabricated sensor exhibits high selectivity, effectively discriminating against interfering species such as uric acid, ascorbic acid, glucose, urea, dopamine, NaCl, and CaCl2. Real-time analysis conducted in a simulated sweat sample via the standard addition method resulted in good recovery percentages of a minimum of 98%. The work presented here is a versatile and simple platform for point-of-care testing, especially for athletes and military personnel.

Activation of zirconia nanophosphors with Eu3+to demonstrate multifunctional optical applications	MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Pristine ZrO2 and Eu3+ activated ZrO2 nanophosphors were synthesized by urea assisted solution combustion method. The synthesized nanophosphors were characterized by Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and photoluminescent (PL) spectroscopy for their structural, morphological, surface, vibrational and luminescent studies. The crystal structure and phase transformation were studied by PXRD which was supported well by XPS and FTIR results. FESEM studies reveal the porous morphology due to the combustion synthesis. XPS results reveal that activator Eu was predominantly present in the +3 oxidation state in the nanpohosphor. PL emission spectra of Eu3+ activated zirconia show characteristic reddish emission corresponding to 5D0 -> 7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) transitions of Eu3+ ion. Photometric parameters were calculated to check the possible application of the nanophosphors for solid-state lighting. The high color purity -94% of the synthesized phosphors indicates their application in phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes (pc-wLEDs). The fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) of non-thermally coupled levels 5D0 -> 7F2 and 5D0 -> 7F3 were used to calculate the temperature. At 623 K, a maximum relative and absolute sensitivity of 0.11% K-1, and 0.76% K-1 was observed. The possible anti-counterfeiting application of ZrO2:Eu3+ has been tested using a standard screenprinting procedure. The high contrast fingerprints of the synthesized phosphor taken under near-ultraviolet (nUV) light indicate that the synthesized phosphor can be used for latent fingerprinting applications. All these results indicate that Eu3+ activated zirconia has the potential to be used as multifunctional material.

Sprr2f protects against renal injury by decreasing the level of reactive oxygen species in female mice	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-RENAL PHYSIOLOGY												Renal injury leads to chronic kidney disease, with which women are not only more likely to be diagnosed than men but have poorer outcomes as well. We have previously shown that expression of small proline-rich region 2f (Sprr2f), a member of the small proline-rich region (Sprr) gene family, is increased several hundredfold after renal injury using a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mouse model. To better understand the role of Sprr2f in renal injury, we generated a Sprr2f knockout (Sprr2f-KO) mouse model using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Sprr2f-KO female mice showed greater renal damage after UUO compared with wild-type (Sprr2f-WT) animals, as evidenced by higher hydroxyproline levels and denser collagen staining, indicating a protective role of Sprr2f during renal injury. Gene expression profiling by RNA sequencing identified 162 genes whose expression levels were significantly different between day 0 and day 5 after UUO in Sprr2f-KO mice. Of the 162 genes, 121 genes were upregulated after UUO and enriched with those involved in oxidation-reduction, a phenomenon not observed in Sprr2f-WT animals, suggesting a protective role of Sprr2f in UUO through defense against oxidative damage. Consistently, bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury resulted in higher serum blood urea nitrogen levels and higher tissue reactive oxygen species in Sprr2f-KO compared with Sprr2f-WT female mice. Moreover, cultured renal epithelial cells from Sprr2f-KO female mice showed lower viability after oxidative damage induced by menadione compared with Sprr2f-WT cells that could be rescued by supplementation with reduced glutathione, suggesting that Sprr2f induction after renal damage acts as a defense against reactive oxygen species.																			1931-857X	1522-1466				NOV	2020	319	5					F876	F884		10.1152/ajprenal.00318.2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.00318.2020								33017192					WOS:000629223900009

In this work, cellulose-based strips (CBS) for the low concentration of glucose detection have been designed based on a fast, sensitive, and easy enzyme colorimetric assay from porous and high-purity cellulose membranes (CM). Different from the traditional paper-based sensors that were made of commercially available filter paper, the cellulose-based membranes matrix was fabricated by a "green" route in that cellulose was dissolved in an aqueous NaOH/urea solution, and then modified by the sodium periodate oxidation method to immobilize the glucose oxidase (GO(x) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with Schiff-base reaction. The structure and properties of CM and CBS were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray mapping (EDS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), etc. SEM images showed a porous, interpenetrating structure of CM, which benefited the enzyme immobilization and enzymatic reaction. When glucose solution was dropped onto the CBS, the color change from colorless to blue was only 5 min. The limit of detection (LOD) is 0.45 mM in the linear range of glucose from 1 to 11 mM. Moreover, the CBS had also been successfully used for glucose determination in real urine samples, and the color changes can be easily recorded by a simple camera to achieve the semiquantitative detection of glucose. This work provided a new design strategy for the cellulose-based functional materials which could be applied in biosensors, drug carriers, and biomedicine.

Lutein attenuates diabetic-induced renal damage via inhibiting oxidative and nitrosative stresses	PROGRESS IN NUTRITION												Diabetic nephropathy is a complex disease that involves production of free radicals, which are strong stimulus for pro-inflammatory factors. Present study was designed to explore the potential alleviating effects of lutein against streptozotocin-induced diabetic renal oxidation, inflammation and apoptosis in rats. Lutein was supplemented with diets content in three different doses (40, 80 and 160 mg/kg diets). Levels of glucose, albumin, creatinine and urea were determined in serum and urine. Renal expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nucleic acids and caspase-3 activity were estimated and also the kidney levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), total and non-protein sulfhydryl groups (T-SH and NP-SH), nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) along with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. Renal histopathological features were analyzed. The diabetic animals showed apparent alterations in serum and urine biochemistry and also demonstrated evident elevated renal levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and apoptosis. Measured oxidative/nitrosative stress biomarkers were found altered markedly in the renal tissues of diabetic rats. Lutein supplementation to the diabetic animals significantly improved serum and urinary biochemistry. In renal tissue, the altered pro-inflammatory cytokines, nucleic acids and caspase-3 activity were ameliorated following lutein supplementation. Diabetic animals supplemented with lutein exhibited normal values of TBARS, T-SH, NP-SH and iNOS as well as SOD and CAT activities particularly in higher dose. Histological analysis further confirmed lutein's renal protective effects. These results demonstrated clear evidence that lutein offered a significant protective effect against diabetes-induced nephrotoxicity by inhibiting the oxidative and nitrosative process in renal tissue.

Effects of curcumin and captopril on the functions of kidney and nerve in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats: role of angiotensin converting enzyme 1	APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY NUTRITION AND METABOLISM												Oxidative stress and inflammation are involved in the development and progression of diabetes and its complications. The renin-angiotensin system also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications. We hypothesized that curcumin and captopril would restore the kidney and nerve functions of diabetic rats through their angiotensin converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) inhibiting activity as well as their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (100 mg.kg(-1) body weight). One week after induction of diabetes, rats were treated with 100 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) curcumin or 50 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) captopril orally for 6 weeks. Compared with diabetic control rats, curcumin-or captopril-treated diabetic rats had significantly improved blood glucose, lipid profile, kidney/body weight ratio, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and pain thresholds assessed by Von Frey filaments, hot plate test, and tail-flick test. Diabetic control rats showed increased levels of total peroxide, renal and neural tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-10, and renal ACE1 compared with nondiabetic rats. Although treatment with either curcumin or captopril restored the altered variables, captopril was more effective in reducing these variables. ACE1 was positively correlated with BUN and creatinine and negatively correlated with paw withdrawal threshold, hot plate reaction time, and tail-flick latency, suggesting a possible causal relationship. We conclude that curcumin and captopril protect against diabetic nephropathy and neuropathy by inhibiting ACE1 as well as oxidation and inflammation. These findings suggest that curcumin and captopril may have a role in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy and neuropathy.

The dry matter (DM) yield and N losses of SRFs were not significantly different from urea and DAP. However, nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide (N2O) losses were unexpectedly low and therefore, it was inferred that nitrate underwent a chemical transformation. It was observed that a thick fibreglass wick interrupted drainage and created an anaerobic condition in the soil. The subsoil was found to have a high extractable total iron and it was postulated that iron played a role in the observed low level of N losses. An investigation was carried out with a factorial design using sand types and rates of N application as the main factors. Two types of sand; with high and low iron concentration and four levels of N applications; 0 (control), 50,100 and 200 kg N ha-1 were employed in a leaching column and nitrate and N2O losses were measured. The nitrate leaching was significantly (P < 0.05) affected by sand types wherein a lower nitrate level was recorded for high-iron concentration sand than for low-iron concentration sand at all N application levels. The N2O emission was significantly (P < 0.05) lower for high-iron sand than for low-iron sand for the 200 N treatment, but not significantly different between sand types for other treatments. These observations provide evidence for the involvement of iron in nitrate transformation under anaerobic conditions and it was hypothesised path was dissimilar nitrate reduction (DNR). Further studies are recommended, to identify the underlying mechanism responsible for nitrate reduction with iron-rich sand.

Herein, this study developed a combined system (TAP-MD) by integrating thermally activated peroxydisulfate (TAP) and MD process to inhibit membrane fouling and improve separation efficiency. Based on the TAP-MD system, the separation performance was improved significantly, improving nutrient recovery efficiency and quality of reclaimed water. More than 80% of water could be recovered from urine, and about 94.13% of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), 99.02% of total nitrogen (TN), 100% of total phosphate (TP), and 100% of K+ were rejected. The mechanism for alleviating urine-induced fouling was systematically and intensively studied. With TAP pre-treatment, the TAN concentration of pretreated urine was kept at a low level steadily and the pH was at neutral or weakly acidic. Hence, inorganic scaling represented by carbonate and phosphate precipitates were significantly inhibited by creating unfavorable solvent environment for crystallization with TAP pretreatment. Additionally, aromatic proteins were found as the main organic foulants. According to the secondary structure of protein, the proteins were degraded by the cleavage of peptide bonds by TAP pretreatment. Meanwhile, the hydrophilicity of protein increased, which reduced the hydrophobic interaction of protein and membrane surface and thus alleviated protein-induced membrane fouling. This study revealed the inorganic and organic foulants in urine that caused membrane fouling and demonstrated the mechanism of membrane fouling alleviation by TAP -MD system. The experimental results will be instrumental in better understanding the mechanisms of membrane fouling induced by urine and optimize MD process for resource recovery from urine.

Herein, biochar doped with nitrogen and sulfur moieties was prepared by pyrolysis of wood shavings and doping precursor. The doping precursor consists of either urea, thiourea or 1:1 w/w mixture of urea and thiourea (denoted as NSB-U, NSB-T and NSB-UT, respectively). The physicochemical properties of the NSBs were extensively characterized, revealing that they are of noncrystalline carbon with porous structure. The NSBs were employed as PMS activator to degrade organic pollutants particularly methylene blue (MB). It was found that NSB-UT exhibited higher MB removal rate with k(app) = 0.202 min(-1) due to its relatively high surface area and favorable intrinsic surface moieties (combination of graphitic N and thiophenic S). The effects of catalyst loading, PMS dosage and initial pH were evaluated. Positive enhancement of the MB removal rate can be obtained by carefully increasing the catalyst loading or PMS dosage. Meanwhile, the MB removal rate is greatly influenced by pH due to electrostatic interactions and pH dependent reactions. The NSB-UT can be reused for several cycles to some extent and its catalytic activity can be restored by thermal treatment. Based on the radical scavenger study and XPS analysis, the nonradical pathway facilitated by the graphitic N and thiophenic S active sites are revealed to be the dominant reaction pathway. Overall, the results of this study show that engineered biochar derived from locally available biowaste can be transformed into PMS activator for environmental applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The TAP-polymerized g-C 3 N 4 composite with 0.5 wt% TAP content showed the highest photocatalytic activity for ciprofloxacin (CIP) degradation under solar irradiation. The optimal composite derived from urea achieved - 10.8 and - 7.5 time of CIP degradation activity when compared with TAPpolymerized g-C 3 N 4 derived from melamine and thiourea. The copolymerization of TAP molecules reduces the pi electron defects in the g-C 3 N 4 conjugated system thus accelerates the migration of photogenerated carriers. The doping of TAP in g-C 3 N 4 reduces its band gap, which enhances the light absorption capacity and improves the utilization efficiency of visible light. The fluffy porous nanotube structure of the material endows it with unique surface morphology and excellent photoelectric characteristic. Electron spin resonance (ESR) and probe technology were used for qualitative or quantitative detection of free radicals in this work. Superoxide radicals ( O & sdot; - 2 ) played the major roles in the photodegradation of CIP. Recycling experiments displayed the high stability and activity of the modified materials, which is potentially applicable in practical engineering. Moreover, the photodegradation pathways and mechanisms of CIP were proposed and its toxicity evolution was assessed in this study. This work revealed the specific application of heterocyclic polymerization in modifying g-C 3 N 4 material and provided unique insights for its application in photocatalytic degradation of antibiotic.

Gills and air-breathing organ in O2uptake, CO2excretion, N-waste excretion, and ionoregulation in small and large pirarucu (Arapaima gigas)	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												In the pirarucu (Arapaima gigas), gill surface area and thus gas exchange capacity of the gills are reduced with proceeding development. It, therefore, is expected thatA. gigas, starting as a water breather, progressively turns into an obligate air-breathing fish using an air-breathing organ (ABO) for gas exchange. We assessed the air-breathing activity, O(2)and CO(2)exchange into air and water, ammonia-N and urea-N excretion, ion flux rates, and activities of ion transport ATPases in large versus small pirarucu. We found that even very youngA. gigas(4-6 g, 2-3 weeks post-hatch) with extensive gills are air-breathers (18.1 breaths*h(-1)) and cover most (63%) of their O(2)requirements from the air whereas 600-700-g animals (about 3-4 months post-hatch), with reduced gills, obtain 75% of their O(2)from the air (10.8 breaths*h(-1)). Accordingly, the reduction in gill surface area hardly affected O(2)uptake, but development had a significant effect on aerial CO(2)excretion, which was very low (3%) in small fish and increased to 12% in larger fish, yielding a hyper-allometric scaling coefficient (1.12) in contrast to 0.82-0.84 for aquatic and total CO(2)excretion. Mass-specific ammonia excretion decreased in approximate proportion to mass-specific O(2)consumption as the fish grew, but urea-N excretion dropped from 18% (at 4-6 g) to 8% (at 600-700 g) of total N-excretion; scaling coefficients for all these parameters were 0.70-0.80. Mass-specific sodium influx and efflux rates, as well as potassium net loss rates, departed from this pattern, being greater in larger fish; hyper-allometric scaling coefficients were > 1.0. Gill V-type H(+)ATPase activities were greater than Na+, K+-ATPase activities, but levels were generally low and comparable in large and small fish, and similar activities were detected in the ABO.A. gigasis a carnivorous fish throughout its lifecycle, and, despite fasting, protein oxidation accounted for the major portion (61-82%) of aerobic metabolism in both large and small animals. ABO PO(2)and PCO2(measured in 600-700-g fish) were quite variable, and aerial hypoxia resulted in lower ABO PO(2)values. Under normoxic conditions, a positive correlation between breath volume and ABP PO(2)was detected, and on average with a single breath more than 50% of the ABO volume was exchanged. ABO PCO(2)values were in the range of 1.95-3.89 kPa, close to previously recorded blood PCO(2)levels. Aerial hypoxia (PO(2)down to 12.65 kPa) did not increase either air-breathing frequency or breath volume.

However, their comparative effects on ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in agricultural soils are still unclear. Here, we compared the impacts of these two inhibitors on soil nitrification, AOA and AOB abundance as well as their community structure in a vegetable soil by using real-time PCR and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). Our results showed that urea application significantly increased the net nitrification rates, but were significantly inhibited by both NIs, and the inhibitory effect of DMPP was significantly greater than that of DCD. AOB growth was more greatly inhibited by DMPP than by DCD, and the net nitrification rate was significantly related to AOB abundance, but not to AOA abundance. Application of urea and NIs to soil did not change the diversity of the AOA community, with the T-RFs remaining in proportions that were similar to control soils, while the community structure of AOB exhibited obvious shifts within all different treatments compared to the control. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all AOA sequences fell within group 1.1a and group 1.1b, and the AOB community consisted of Nitrosospira cluster 3, cluster 0, and unidentified species. These results suggest that DMPP exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect on nitrification than DCD by inhibiting AOB rather than AOA.

Accordingly, it is reasonable to predict that diverse AOA lineages would grow in ammonium (NH4+)-rich alkaline arable soils if AOB growth is suppressed. To test this hypothesis, a microcosm study was established using three different types of alkaline arable soils, in which a high NH4 concentration (200 mu g N g(-1) dry soil) was maintained by routinely replenishing urea and the activities of AOB were selectively inhibited by 1-octyne or 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). Compared with amendment with urea alone, 1-octyne partially retarded AOB growth, while DMPP completely inhibited AOB. Both inhibitors accelerated the growth of AOA, with significantly higher ratios of abundance of AOA to AOB observed with DMPP amendment across soils. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) indicated that different treatments significantly altered the community structures of both AOA and AOB and AOA OTUs enriched by high-NH4+ amendment were taxonomically constrained across the soils tested and closely related to Nitrososphaera viennensis EN76 and N. garnensis. Given that these representative strains have been demonstrated to be sensitive to high ammonia concentrations, our results suggest that it is the competitiveness for ammonia, rather than disparities in substrate affinity and tolerance threshold for ammonia, that drives niche differentiation between these phylotypes and AOB in NH4+-rich alkaline soils.

First, TiO, nanorod arrays were grown onto a FTO substrate by a hydrothermal method. Second, g-C3N4 was coated onto the TiO2 nanorod arrays by immersing the above substrate with TiO2 nanorod arrays into a solution of urea and then heated at higher temperature. In this procedure, the amount of the g-C3N4 on the TiO2 nanorod arrays can be controlled by tuning the concentration of the urea solution. At last, Co-Pi were decorated on the surface of the TiO2@g-C3N4 by electrodeposition. The as-prepared CCNRs were characterized by XRD, FESEM, TEM, XPS, UV-vis, and FTIR, respectively, which illustrated that Co-Pi moieties were successfully decorated on the hybrid TiO2@gC(3)N(4) nanorod arrays. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements have demonstrated that the prepared CCNRs serve as an efficient and stable photoanode for PEG seawater splitting. The photocurrent density reaches 1.6 mA/cm(2) under 100 mW/cm(2) (AM1.5G) light illumination at 1.23 V (RHE). More significantly, the CCNRs photoanode is quite stable during seawater splitting and the performance remain undiminished even after 10 h continuous illumination. Finally, a systematical photocatalytic mechanism of the Co-Pi decorated TiO2@g-C3N4 was proposed, and it can be considered as potential explanation of enhanced PEC performance.

M.; Lucker, Sebastian			Complete nitrification by a single microorganism	NATURE												Nitrification is a two-step process where ammonia is first oxidized to nitrite by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and/or archaea, and subsequently to nitrate by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. Already described by Winogradsky in 18901, this division of labour between the two functional groups is a generally accepted characteristic of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle(2). Complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate in one organism (complete ammonia oxidation; comammox) is energetically feasible, and it was postulated that this process could occur under conditions selecting for species with lower growth rates but higher growth yields than canonical ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms(3). Still, organisms catalysing this process have not yet been discovered. Here we report the enrichment and initial characterization of two Nitrospira species that encode all the enzymes necessary for ammonia oxidation via nitrite to nitrate in their genomes, and indeed completely oxidize ammonium to nitrate to conserve energy. Their ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) enzymes are phylogenetically distinct from currently identified AMOs, rendering recent acquisition by horizontal gene transfer from known ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms unlikely. We also found highly similar amoA sequences (encoding the AMO subunit A) in public sequence databases, which were apparently misclassified as methane monooxygenases. This recognition of a novel amoA sequence group will lead to an improved understanding of the environmental abundance and distribution of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. Furthermore, the discovery of the long-sought-after comammox process will change our perception of the nitrogen cycle.

Optimal conditions of pH 4.0 and the cobalt ratio were obtained, with high decontamination performance and low leaching. Characterizations of Co/C3N4 indicate that Co/C3N4 synthesized with different precursors showed similar chemical and crystal structures while exhibiting differences in surface morphology and pore structure. Due to the high specific surface area and pore volume, Co/C3N4 with a precursor of urea showed the best activity, k1, for carbamazepine removal, which was 0.07193 min-1, higher than those with precursors of dicyandiamide (0.05084 min-1) and melamine (0.03499 min-1). The main active species for decontamination was identified by quenching experiments, chemical trapping, electron paramagnetic resonance analysis, and isotope labeling, and the results suggest that high-valent cobalt was the main active species and HO center dot showed minor efficiency for pollutant degradation. The degradation pathway of carbamazepine was proposed, and the results further confirm the main active species of high-valent cobalt, which mainly reacted with the amino group. Moreover, the practicability of Co/C3N4- activated peracetic acid was evaluated by recycling use, different pollutant treatments, and real wastewater treatment. The results indicate the systems showed better decontamination performance for carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and bisphenol S, could effectively resist the interference of the substrate in real wastewater, and could efficiently remove CBZ within five reuse cycles. This study understood the activity and mechanisms of Co/C3N4-activated peracetic acid with different precursors, which might give new ideas on supporter structure design for Fenton-like catalysis improvement.

The results showed that CeO2@AC exhibits good catalytic activity with excellent stability. The ozonation reaction catalyzed by CeO2@AC led to a complete removal of OA (1.5 mM, 0.5 g/L catalyst) in 60 min and showed a 75% increase in OA removal compared to the single non-catalytic ozonation. After five consecutive reuse cycles, CeO2@AC showed almost the same catalytic performance with few only changes in ceria content and surface morphology.

The catalysts were characterized by ammonia oxidation, N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). Catalytic activity tests reveal that catalyst WO3/Ce0.65Zr0.35O2 has the best catalytic activity and a good resistance to hydrothermal aging. It is light-off at 200 degrees C and has the highest NOx conversion of 96% at 350 degrees C. The reaction window of 80% NOx conversion is in the temperature range of 241-457 degrees C with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 30,000 h(-1). Moreover, it has a good SO2 tolerance and good ability to fit the high GHSV, which suggests that it has a good prospect for real application. Characterization experiments show that WO3/Ce0.65Zr0.35O2 has a weaker property of ammonia oxidation, a larger surface area, strong oxidation property with the highest binding energy of Ce, Zr and O, and the most surface medium-strength acid. These characteristics are the main factors that lead to the increased SCR activity. (C) 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Acute kidney injury (AKI) was induced by cecal ligation perforation (CLP) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Using this AKI animal model, the survival rate of the rats was evaluated at different time points after Cur treatment to explore whether Cur can improve survival in an animal model of AKI. The expression levels of inflammatory factors (NF-kappa B, TNF-alpha, and IL-10), organ injury markers [urea nitrogen (UN), creatinine (Cr), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), amylase, creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)], and disease progression markers [neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and cystatin-C (CysC)] were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The serum levels of UN, Cr, NF-kappa B, ALT, AST, amylase, CK, LDH, inflammatory factors TNF-alpha and IL-10, and markers of early diagnosis of SAKI (NGAL, CysC, KLM-1) were significantly lower in the curcumin group than those in the placebo group (P<0.05). In addition, serum levels of TI,R9 and its downstream molecules MyD88, IRF5, and IRF7 in the curcumin group were significantly lower than those in the placebo group (P<0.05). The application of TLR9-specific inhibitors to experimental rats led to similar results as those obtained in the curcumin group, whose detection indexes were significantly lower than those in the placebo treatment group (P<0.05). Conclusions: Given the excellent performance of Cur in anti-tumor, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, and other clinical trials, it is very likely to be further developed as a potential drug for the clinical treatment of AKI.

In this study, we employed a highly efficient and cost-effective method, namely, DC arc plasma, to synthesize carbon-coated vanadium carbide (VC@C) core-shell nanoparticles in a one-step process. The synthesized VC@C material was subsequently nitrogen-doped using urea as a nitrogen (N) source in a tube furnace, resulting in the formation of N-doped carbon-coated VC [VC@C(Nx)] catalysts for ORR electro-catalysis in alkaline media. Real-time optical emission spectroscopy (OES) analysis offers an in-depth comprehension of the energy states involved in the synthesis process of VC@C nanocrystalline powders. Highlighting the plasma states at various stages throughout the synthesis, provides a solid basis for dissecting the formation of VC@C nanoparticles and elucidating the intricate nature of their core-shell structures. Compared to the VC@C catalyst, the VC@C(N10) catalyst exhibited a significant improvement in both half-wave and onset potential, approaching the performance levels comparable to Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, VC@C(N10) demonstrated superior ORR kinetics, stability, and methanol tolerance. The exceptional performance of VC@C(N10) could be primarily attributed to the introduction of nitrogen doping, which generated more active sites and enhanced the synergistic cooperation between the VC core and the nitrogen-doped carbon shell. Additionally, the protective effect from the carbon shell prevented corrosion and oxidation of the VC core. This study represents a new exploration in the quest for the development of stable and efficient non-precious metal catalysts for ORR applications.

However, scalable and cost-effective synthesis of active metal-nitrogen catalysts is yet to be developed. Herein, we report a simple and sustainable method that utilizes commercial carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to adsorb a pharmaceutical waste, sulfamethoxazole (SMX), followed by moderate pyrolysis to prepare an efficient M-N-C catalyst. The intrinsic metal impurities from CNTs are essential to form active metal sites, and it requires significantly less nitrogen precursor than methods using most widely nitrogen precursors such as melamine and urea. The CNT-SMX catalyst delivers high CO2RR performance with 91.5 % CO Faradaic efficiency and 14 mA/cm(2) CO partial current density at 0.76 V vs RHE in a traditional H-Cell. The catalyst is also efficient in a scalable flow cell, exhibiting 97.5 % CO selectivity at 300 mA/cm(2), plus stable CO2RR performance for more than 24 h at 100 mA/cm(2). The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analyses confirm the existence of single atomic sites primarily in the form of Fe-N bonds that are active sites for CO2RR. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a synergy between the single atomic Fe-N-C sites and Ni nanoparticles embedded in the CNTs, which enhances CO production rate and selectivity by lowering the desorption energy of *CO intermediate. To the best of our knowledge, the results in this work are among the top performing carbon-based catalysts. Furthermore, catalysts developed in this work are synthesized at a moderate temperature without pre-oxidation or post-acid-washing and utilize cheap or waste materials, presenting a simple, sustainable, and cost-effective way to synthesize highly active catalysts.

Nitrosopumilus zosterae sp. nov., an autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing archaeon of phylum Thaumarchaeota isolated from coastal eelgrass sediments of Japan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY												A novel mesophilic and aerobic ammonia- oxidizing archaeon of the phylum Thaumarchaeota, strain NM25T, was isolated from coastal eelgrass zone sediment sampled in Shimoda (Japan). The cells were rod- shaped with an S- layer cell wall. The temperature range for growth was 20-37 degrees C, with an optimum at 30 degrees C. The pH range for growth was pH 6.1-7.7, with an optimum at pH 7.1. The salinity range for growth was 5-40 %, with an optimum range of 15-32 %. Cells obtained energy from ammonia oxidation and used bicarbonate as a carbon source. Utilization of urea was not observed for energy generation and growth. Strain NM25T required a hydrogen peroxide scavenger, such as alpha-ketoglutarate, pyruvate or catalase, for sustained growth on ammonia. Growth of strain NM25T was inhibited by addition of low concentrations of some organic compounds and organic mixtures, including complete inhibition by glycerol, peptone and yeast extract. Phylogenetic analysis of four concatenated housekeeping genes (16S rRNA, rpoB, rpsI and atpD) and concatenated AmoA, AmoB, AmoC amino acid sequences indicated that the isolate is similar to members of the genus Nitrosopumilus. The closest relative is Nitrosopumilus ureiphilus PS0T with sequence similarities of 99.5 % for the 16S rRNA gene and 97.2 % for the amoA gene. Genome relatedness between strain NM25T and N. ureiphilus PS0T was assessed by average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization, giving results of 85.4 and 40.2 %, respectively. On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic data, strain NM25T represents a novel species of the genus Nitrosopumilus, for which the name sp. nov, is proposed. The type strain is NM25T (=NBRC 111181T=ATCC TSD-147T).

J	Ansari, E; Shahbakhti, M; Naber, J				Ansari, Ehsan; Shahbakhti, Mandi; Naber, Jeffrey			Optimization of performance and operational cost for a dual mode diesel-natural gas RCCI and diesel combustion engine	APPLIED ENERGY												Diesel-NG fuel blends are increasingly being used in Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) internal combustion engines due to high Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE), low NOx and PM emissions. It also has few disadvantages such as high unburned Hydro Carbon (HC) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) emissions and relatively low Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT). This study determines the optimum combustion mode between RCCI and Conventional Diesel Combustion (CDC) at different loads while meeting the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emission regulation. A Cost Function (CF) including Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) and Brake Specific Urea Consumption (BSUC) is considered and minimized in this study. The optimization of input variables is done between 3 and 12 bar Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP) engine load. The study aims to calibrate the dual fuel diesel/NG RCCI engine to meet Tier 3 Bin 20 EPA standard, with or without after treatment system, while minimizing the cost of operation. New parametric empirical models are developed and validated using experimental data from a light duty 1.9L inline 4 cylinder Compression Ignition (CI) engine as a function of independent input variables. All the experiments were conducted at Advanced Power System (APS) facility at Michigan Technological University. These models predict HC, CO, PM and NOx emissions, EGT and BSFC. These models are then used to predict new operating points to increase the population in the optimization process. The computed EGT is used to estimate the Selective Catalyst Reduction (SCR) and Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) efficiencies to assess the emission data with different input variables by considering the after-treatment system to see if they meet the tailpipe emission regulation. The optimization results recommend using Diesel/NG RCCI at 7 to 12 bar IMEP operating conditions and use CDC for below 7 bar IMEP operating condition.

Novel cobalt-based aerogels for uric acid detection in fluids at physiological pH	BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS												A sensor for uric acid (UA) based on the urate oxidase enzyme (UOx) immobilized in novel Co-based aerogels with transition metals synthesized by the sol-gel method was developed and evaluated. The Co-based aerogels: Co, Ni-Co and Pd-Co were physicochemically characterized by XRD and HR-TEM. The surface area values of 53, 57 and 66 m2 g-1 were determined for Co, Ni-Co and Pd-Co, respectively by N2 adsorption-desorption technique. Co-based aerogels were mixed by cross-linking with UOx enzymes and electrochemically characterized in buffers at pH 7.4 and 5.6 (pH values reported for biological fluids such as blood and sweat) in the presence of different uric acid concentrations. Co-based aerogels with UOx showed improved performance as a uric acid biosensor compared to using the enzyme alone. At a pH of 7.4, a higher sensitivity of 11 mu A mu M- 1 was obtained with Pd-Co/ UOx, 1.6 times higher than with UOx. At a pH value of 5.6, the highest sensitivity is achieved with Ni-Co/UOx. Stability and selectivity tests were performed in the presence of biological interferents without significant changes in the sensor. These results indicate a pleasing synergistic activity between Co-based aerogels and the enzyme.

J	Zhang, SZ; Nie, XX; Bi, YH; Yan, J; Liu, SH; Peng, YY				Zhang, Size; Nie, Xuexuan; Bi, Yuhua; Yan, Jie; Liu, Shaohua; Peng, Yiyuan			Experimental Study on NOx  Reduction of Diesel Engine by EGR Coupled with SCR	ACS OMEGA												Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) are crucial technologies for mitigating nitrogen oxide (NOx ) emissions in diesel engines. Although EGR reduces engine outlet NOx emissions, it simultaneously increases diesel consumption, leading to a poor economic performance. SCR requires AdBlue consumption; thus, striking the right balance for overall engine economy is of utmost importance. This study aims to evaluate NOx emission control and fluid cost in diesel engines. The total fluid cost of the diesel engine includes diesel and AdBlue. The engine is equipped with an aftertreatment system comprising a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), diesel particulate filter (DPF), selective catalytic reduction (SCR), and ammonia slip catalyst (ASC). The study was carried out at 1600 and 2100 rpm (25, 50, 75, and 100% load). The results show that with the increase of EGR valve opening, the exhaust temperature increased, the brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increased, and the NOx emission decreased. With the increased AdBlue dosage, the NOx conversion efficiency gradually improved, ultimately approaching near-zero NOx emissions. However, as NOx emissions decreased, the equivalent diesel fluid cost rose. At 1600 r/min (100% load), when the NOx emissions were reduced by zero, the maximum fluid costs were 235, 223, and 218g/(kW center dot h) under the AdBlue/diesel price ratios of 1/1, 1/2, and 1/3, respectively. As the AdBlue/diesel price ratio decreases, the influence of EGR on the fluid cost diminishes. Coordinated control of EGR and AdBlue allows for reduced NOx emissions while mitigating the overall cost of diesel engines and aftertreatment systems. This research provides valuable guidance for EGR and urea control in diesel engines and contributes to the field of diesel engine emission control.

Changes in salivary analytes in cows due to the in vitro presence of feed	BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH												Background The effect in a sialochemistry profile of the presence of usually available feed in dairy cows was evaluated by an in vitro experiment. For this purpose, a pooled clean saliva from five healthy dairy cows was incubated five times with a standard feed based on a total mixed ration (F), wheat hay (H), and grass (G). The salivary panel was integrated by biomarkers of stress (cortisol -sCor-, salivary alpha-amylase -sAA-, butyrylcholinesterase -BChE-, total esterase -TEA-, and lipase -Lip-), immunity (adenosine deaminase -ADA-), oxidative status (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity -TEAC-, the ferric reducing ability of saliva -FRAS-, the cupric reducing antioxidant capacity -CUPRAC-, uric acid, and advanced oxidation protein products -AOPP-), and enzymes, proteins, and minerals of general metabolism and markers of liver, muscle, and renal damage (aspartate aminotransferase -AST-, alanine aminotransferase -ALP-, gamma-glutamyl transferase -gGT-, lactate dehydrogenase -LDH-, creatine kinase -CK-, creatinine, urea, triglycerides, glucose, lactate, total protein, phosphorus, and total calcium). Results Most of the evaluated analytes showed a coefficient of variations (CV) higher than 15% and/or significant changes compared with the clean saliva when feed was present. Some analytes, such as the oxidative status biomarkers (CV > 80%), AST (CV > 60%), or glucose (CV > 100%), showed significant changes with all the feed types tested. Others showed significant differences only with certain types of feed, such as LDH with F (CV > 60%) or triglycerides with F (CV > 100%) and H (CV > 95%). However, sCor or gGT remained unchanged (CV < 15%, P > 0.05) in all the treatments. Conclusions The presence of feed can produce changes in most of the analytes measured in cows' saliva, being of high importance to consider this factor when saliva is used as a sample to avoid errors in the interpretation of the results.

Magneto-Optical and Catalytic Properties of Recyclable Spinel NiAl2O4 Nanostructures Using Facile Combustion Methods	JOURNAL OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND NOVEL MAGNETISM												Spinel nickel aluminate (NiAl (2) O (4)) nanospheres (NSPs) and nanoplatelets (NPLs) were successfully synthesized using a facile microwave combustion method (MCM) and conventional combustion method (CCM), respectively, using urea as the fuel. The as-prepared samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) analysis. Powder XRD, FT-IR, EDX, and SAED results showed that the samples were pure phase spinel NiAl (2) O (4) nanocrystals without any other secondary phase impurity. UV-Vis DRS and PL spectroscopy results were used to calculate the energy band gap (E (g)) value of the samples which is 3.41 and 3.08 eV for NiAl (2) O (4) NSPs and NiAl (2) O (4) NPLs, respectively. VSM results of the NiAl (2) O (4) NPLs sample show lower M (s) (49.16 x 10 (-3) emu/g) values compared with the NiAl (2) O (4) NSPs sample (73.42 x 10 (-3) emu/g), which confirm that both the products have ferromagnetic behavior. NiAl (2) O (4) NSPs were found to have higher surface area than NiAl (2) O (4) NPLs, which in turn leads to the improved performance towards the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde, with 100 % selectivity, and it was found that the NiAl (2) O (4) NSPs sample show higher conversion (96.25 %) than NiAl (2) O (4) NPLs (85.37 %). The as-prepared samples show high activity, good reusability, remarkable stability, and environmentally friendly materials for industrial and technological applications.

Exogenous porcine somatotropin administered to late pregnant gilts alters liver and muscle functionalities in pig foetuses	ANIMAL												Neonatal maturity depends on the maternal capacity to provide nutrients for foetal growth. This study aimed to investigate the effects of systemic administration of recombinant porcine somatotropin (pST), one of the main regulators of growth and metabolism, to pregnant gilts during late gestation on circulat-ing nutrients and expression levels of genes in liver and skeletal muscle of their 110-day-old foetuses. Gilts received either daily injections of sterile water (control [CTL] group, n = 15) or of 5 mg of pST (pST group, n = 17) from days 90 to 109 of gestation. At day 110 postconceptus, pairs of foetuses (one of small and one of average size within a litter) were selected. Circulating fructose concentrations were greater, but circulating concentrations of urea were lower in pST than in CTL foetuses. Expression levels of genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were more affected by pST treatment in liver than in muscle. Hepatic molecular changes suggest an inhibition of energy-consuming processes (glycogen and lipid biosynthesis) and the activation of energy-producing pathway (mitochondrial oxidation) in pST compared to CTL foetuses. Expression levels of some genes involved in intracellular degradation of proteins were greater in the liver of pST foetuses, and combined with lower uremia, this suggests a higher utilisation of protein sources in pST foetuses than in CTL foetuses. In muscle, molecular changes were mainly observed in the IGF-insulin axis. Altogether, pST-treated gilts seem to have a greater ability to support foetal liver development by the reorientation of energy and protein metabolism. (c) 2022 The Authors.

J	Muznebin, F; Alfaro, AC; Venter, L; Young, T				Muznebin, Farhana; Alfaro, Andrea C.; Venter, Leonie; Young, Tim			Acute thermal stress and endotoxin exposure modulate metabolism and immunity in marine mussels (Perna canaliculus)	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												Mass mortalities of New Zealand Green-lipped mussels (Perna canaliculus) are thought to be associated with increased water temperatures and immune challenges from opportunistic pathogens. However, the combined effects of acute thermal stress and immune stimulation on mussels are poorly understood. To investigate these responses, adult mussels were exposed to different temperatures (26 C [thermal stress] vs 15 C [ambient]) and a bacterial-derived endotoxin injection (with vs without) to mimic a pathogen infection. Various immunological and metabolic parameters were measured over two days via enzyme staining reactions, flow cytometry, and metabolomic profiling. None of the treatments impacted total and differential haemocyte counts, haemocyte viability or production of reactive oxygen species. Acid phosphatase and phenoloxidase activities were detected only within granulocytes (not in hyalinocytes), although their relative expressions also were not affected. Conversely, metabolite profiling exposed impacts of thermal stress and endotoxin exposure at a metabolic level, indicative of physiological changes in energy expenditure and partitioning. At the higher water temperature, free fatty acid and amino acid constituents increased and decreased, respectively, which supports an elevated energy demand and higher metabolic rate due to thermal stress. Ultimately, energy production is being sustained via multiple routes including the glycolysis pathway, TCA cycle, and beta-oxidation. Additionally, branched-chain amino acids, the urea cycle and the glutathione pathway were affected by the higher temperature. The metabolic response of mussels exposed to endotoxin exposure resulted in increased metabolite response largely linked to protein and lipid degradation. After 5 days of exposure, survival data confirmed a severe physiological impact of the higher temperature through incidences of mortality. However, the thermal challenge in combination with the specific endotoxin treatment applied did not lead to a synergistic effect on mortality. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between thermal stress and immunity to better understand the immune defence system in mussels.

Self-Assembly of Aqueous Bilirubin Ditaurate, a Natural Conjugated Bile Pigment, to Contraposing Enantiomeric Dimers and M(-) and P(+) Tetramers and Their Selective Hydrophilic Disaggregation by Monomers and Micelles of Bile Salts	BIOCHEMISTRY												The solution behavior of bilirubin ditaurate (BDT), the first naturally occurring conjugated bile pigment to be physically and chemically characterized, was assessed in aqueous solution and in monomeric and micellar solutions of common taurine-conjugated bile salts (BS). Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that BDT self-associates in monomer-dimer equilibria between 1 and 500 mu M, forming limiting tetramers at low millimolar concentrations. Self-association was enthalpically driven with Delta G values of approximate to 5 kcal/mol, suggesting strong hydrophobic interactions. Added NaCl and decreases in temperature shifted the oligomerization to lower BDT concentrations. On the basis of circular dichroism spectra and the limiting size of the self-aggregates, we infer that the tetramers are composed of 2P(+) and 2M(-) enantiomeric BDT pairs in "ridge-tile" conformations interacting in a "double-bookend" structure. With added monomeric BS, blue shifts in the UV-vis spectra and tight isosbestic points revealed that BDT/BS heterodimers form, followed by BDT "decorating" BS micelles mostly via hydrophilic interactions. Conformational enantiomerism, fluorescence intensities, and anisotropy, as well as resistance of the hybrid particles to disaggregation in 6 M urea, suggested that two or three hydrogen-bonding sites bound BDT monomers to the hydroxyl groups of BS, possibly via pyrrole-pi-orbital-OH interactions. BDT stabilized these interactions by enveloping the BS in its "ridge-tile" pincers with variable strain that maximized van der Waals interactions. Possibly because the BDT molecule becomes highly strained with BS subtending a 7 beta-hydroxyl group, BDT became totally resistant to oxidation in air. This work predicts that, because of BS dissolution of the BDT self-aggregates, BS/bilirubin hybrid particles, which are stabilized hydrophilically, are likely to be the dominant mode of transport for all conjugated bilirubins in bile.

Methods: After an excessive fatigue mouse model was created, anwulignan was administered to the mice, and its effect on exercise tolerance was studied by the weight-bearing swimming test, rotarod test, grip strength test, and tail suspension test. The biochemical indicators closely related to fatigue, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactic acid (LD), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) in the serum; liver glycogen (LG) in the liver tissue; muscle glycogen (MG); inorganic phosphate (Pi) and Annexin V in the gastrocnemius; superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities; malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS); and the 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) content in both serum and the gastrocnemius were detected. Morphological changes were also observed. The anti-fatigue-related proteins of the NRF2/ARE, Bcl2, and PGC-1 alpha pathways in the gastrocnemius of the mice were detected by western blot. Results: Anwulignan significantly increased the exercise tolerance by decreasing BUN, LD, LDH, CK, Pi, MDA, TBARS, 8-OHdG, ROS, and Annexin V levels and increasing LG, MG, SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px levels, significantly upregulated the expression of NRF2 and Bcl2 proteins, which are anti-oxidation and anti-apoptosis regulators, and also activated the p38MAPK-PGC-1 alpha pathway. Conclusion: Anwulignan can increase exercise tolerance and relieve fatigue in an excessive fatigue mouse model. The underlying mechanism may be through its regulatory effect on the NRF2 and PGC-1 alpha signaling pathway. This study will provide scientific data for anwulignan to be developed as a novel and efficient component in anti-oxidant or anti-fatigue health food.					zhang, xinyun/IVV-5138-2023; Sun, Jinghui/AAB-3845-2020; Jing, Shutong/HMD-7138-2023														2042-6496	2042-650X				DEC 1	2019	10	12					7755	7766		10.1039/c9fo01182j	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9fo01182j								31696200					WOS:000507643700012

The effects of pulse frequency and duty cycle on the microdischarge characteristics and coating microstructure were investigated. The results show that the pulse frequency has a small effect on the breakdown voltage. However, the micropore size in the formed worm-like feature of the sample surface increases with increasing pulse frequency. Carbide, nitride and oxide phases were identified in the PEN/C layers. The microhardness increases with increasing pulse frequency. Increasing duty cycle results in a gradual decrease of the breakdown voltage. At low duty cycles, both crater-shaped regions and worm-like features were observed. However, the microhardness of the formed PEN/C layers exhibits a minute variation, in spite of the increase of the duty cycle.

J	Sharifi, R; Dolati, A; Seif, A				Sharifi, Ruhollah; Dolati, Abolghasem; Seif, Abdolvahab			Ultra-fast synthesis of transition metal-MXene nanocomposite electrocatalyst for energy-saving seawater hydrogen production: Experiment and theory	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												Switching from the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a beneficial way to lower the amount of energy needed to make hydrogen gas during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Due to the sluggish reaction kinetics of the six electrons reaction of UOR, designing a privileged bifunctional electrocatalyst for both HER and UOR necessitates. The 2D nano-sized non-noble metal electrocatalysts make it possible to speed up reactions and improve their electrocatalytic performance. We synthesized nickel-cobalt-MXene composite nanosheets (NiCoMXene) on the surface of copper foam using a one-pot, simple, and ultra-fast electrochemical method. This 2D electrocatalyst demonstrates high electrocatalytic performance towards HER (overpotential of 76 mV at-10 mA cm- 2 ) with excellent durability in alkaline media. Furthermore, NiCoMXene nanocomposite served as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to investigate hydrogen gas production by a hybrid system HER coupled with UOR in seawater. The NiCoMXene requires a low overpotential for HER (81 mV) and UOR (1.38 V) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm- 2 in seawater, and the needed cell voltage to reach the same current density is 1.42 V in seawater. Our DFT analysis found a significant synergy between MXene and NiCo in the electrocatalyst. PDOS analysis showed remarkably that introducing Ni atoms to MXene shifts the dband center to the left (lower energy), while Co atoms shifts it to the right (higher energy) and increased states near the Fermi level. This electronic structure makes the nanocomposite an ideal electrocatalyst, with MXene providing electrons and Co atoms serving as active sites for both HER and UOR. This research work can provide a useful directive to explore the electrocatalysts with outstanding catalytic activity.

Kidney disease is a worldwide health and economic burden, with rising prevalence. The search for biomarkers for earlier and more effective disease screening and monitoring is needed. Oxidative stress has been linked to both, acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of our study was to investigate whether the concentrations of systemic markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant status are affected by AKI and CKD, and to identify potential biomarkers. Methods. In adult male Wistar rats, AKI was induced by bilateral nephrectomy, and CKD was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy. Blood was collected 48 hours after surgery in AKI and 6 months after surgery in CKD. Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), fructosamine, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were measured. Results. Impaired renal function was confirmed by high concentrations of plasma creatinine and urea in AKI and CKD animals. AOPP and fructosamine were higher by 100% and 54% in AKI, respectively, and by 100% and 199% in CKD, respectively, when compared to corresponding control groups. Similarly, there was approximately a twofold increase in AGEs (by 92%) and TAC (by 102%) during AKI. In CKD, concentrations of FRAP, as an antioxidative status marker, were doubled (by 107%) when compared to the control group, but concentration of TAC, another marker of antioxidative status, did not differ between the groups. Conclusions. AKI and CKD led to increased systemic oxidative stress. AOPP and fructosamine could be considered potential biomarkers for both, acute and chronic kidney damage. On the other hand, AGEs, TAC, and FRAP seem to be disease specific, which could help to differentiate between acute and chronic kidney injuries. However, this needs further validation in clinical studies.

Understanding their behavioral and physiological disparities is crucial for assessing their ecological success and aquacultural value. The recent finding of non-native M. trossulus in the White Sea raises concerns regarding its potential competition with native M. edulis and its prospective spread in light of climate change and surface water freshening. We investigated the responses of M. edulis and M. trossulus to salinity variations by examining shell closure thresholds and tissue levels of 35 metabolic intermediates in mussels acclimated to different salinities (25, 16, and 10). The salinity threshold for valve closure was similar in both studied species, but M. trossulus consistently opened at lower salinities (by 0.2-0.7 practical salinity units) compared to M. edulis. Salinity-induced changes in metabolite levels were similar between the two species. Taurine emerged as the dominant osmolyte, comprising over 50% of the total free amino acid pool, with aspartate and glycine contributing 15-30%. Concentrations of taurine, glycine, and total free amino acids declined with decreasing salinity. Taurine to glycine ratios were higher in M. edulis and increased in both species with declining salinity. Acclimation salinity significantly influenced urea cycle intermediates and methionine sulfoxide content, a cellular biomarker of amino acid oxidation. Species-specific differences were observed in purine metabolism, with higher levels of GMP and AMP found in M. edulis. Likewise, aromatic amino acids and histidine levels were higher in M. edulis compared to M. trossulus. However, no evidence suggests superior adaptation of M. trossulus metabolism to hypoosmotic stress compared to M. edulis. Further research is necessary to elucidate the functional implications of subtle metabolic differences between these Mytilus congeners and their ecological consequences in changing marine environments.

Integration of omics data and epidemiological data is a key step toward directly linking phthalate biomonitoring data with biological response. Urine metabolomics is a powerful tool to identify exposure biomarkers and delineate the modes of action of environmental stressors. The objectives of this study are to investigate the association between low-level environmental phthalate exposure and urine metabolome alteration in male population, and to unveil the metabolic pathways involved in the mechanisms of phthalate toxicity. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we studied the urine metabolomic profiles of 364 male subjects exposed to low-level environmental phthalates. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) are the most widely used phthalates. Sigma DEHP and MBP (the major metabolite of DBP) were associated with significant alteration of global urine metabolome in the male population. We observed significant increase in the levels of acetylneuraminic acid, carnitine C8:1, carnitine C18:0, cystine, phenylglycine, phenylpyruvic acid and glutamylphenylalanine; and meanwhile, decrease in the levels of carnitine C16:2, diacetylspermine, alanine, taurine, tryptophan, ornithine, methylglutaconic acid, hydroxyl-PEG2 and keto-PGE2 in high exposure group. The observations indicated that low-level environmental phthalate exposure associated with increased oxidative stress and fatty acid oxidation and decreased prostaglandin metabolism. Urea cycle, tryptophan and phenylalanine metabolism disruption was also observed. The urine metabolome disruption effects associated with Sigma DEHP and MBP were similar, but not identical. The multibiomarker models presented AUC values of 0.845 and 0.834 for Sigma DEHP and MBP, respectively. The predictive accuracy rates of established models were 81% for Sigma DEHP and 73% for MBP. Our results suggest that low-level environmental phthalate exposure associates with urine metabolome disruption in male population, providing new insight into the early molecular events of phthalate exposure.

Soil samples were incubated over 50 days and the content of ammonium (N - NH4 + ), nitrate (N - NO3 - ), and soil pH were measured periodically. Applied NIs delayed the nitrification process across all soil textures. Correlation analysis indicated that combining ASN with NIs resulted in higher NH4 + content and efficiency in delaying the nitrification process with high N-conversion rate (r = -0.82). The combination of ASN+ DMPP increased the efficiency of the N-conversion rate (r = -0.86) due to H+ release in soil, while UR+DCD (r = -0.50) had an efficiency of the N-conversion rate similar to UR (r = -0.42). All the NIs had a better performance in reducing N - NO3 - formation in sandy soils as compared to the loam and clay textured soils. Use of DMPP with an N fertilizer results in a soil pH decrease and can be an option to increase the efficiency of the N-conversion rate, reducing N losses in soil. Overall, our results suggest that NIs have a better performance in reducing N - NO3 - formation in sandy soils as compared to that of the loam and clay textured soils. Use of DMPP with ASN results in a soil pH decrease and can be an option to reduce N losses in soil.

Hepatic pyruvate and alanine metabolism are critical and complementary for maintenance of antioxidant capacity and resistance to oxidative insult	MOLECULAR METABOLISM												Objective: Mitochondrial pyruvate is a critical intermediary metabolite in gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and NADH production. As a result, the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) complex has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in metabolic diseases. Clinical trials are currently underway. However, recent in vitro data indicate that MPC inhibition diverts glutamine/glutamate away from glutathione synthesis and toward glutaminolysis to compensate for loss of pyruvate oxidation, possibly sensitizing cells to oxidative insult. Here, we explored this in vivo using the clinically relevant acetaminophen (APAP) overdose model of acute liver injury, which is driven by oxidative stress. Methods: We used pharmacological and genetic approaches to inhibit MPC2 and alanine aminotransferase 2 (ALT2), individually and concomitantly, in mice and cell culture models and determined the effects on APAP hepatotoxicity. Results: We found that MPC inhibition sensitizes the liver to APAP-induced injury in vivo only with concomitant loss of alanine aminotransferase 2 (ALT2). Pharmacological and genetic manipulation of neither MPC2 nor ALT2 alone affected APAP toxicity, but liver-specific double knockout (DKO) significantly worsened APAP-induced liver damage. Further investigation indicated that DKO impaired glutathione synthesis and increased urea cycle flux, consistent with increased glutaminolysis, and these results were reproducible in vitro. Finally, induction of ALT2 and posttreatment with dichloroacetate both reduced APAP-induced liver injury, suggesting new therapeutic avenues. Conclusions: Increased susceptibility to APAP toxicity requires loss of both the MPC and ALT2 in vivo, indicating that MPC inhibition alone is insufficient to disrupt redox balance. Furthermore, the results from ALT2 induction and dichloroacetate in the APAP model suggest new metabolic approaches to the treatment of liver damage. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Effects of hypoxia and reoxygenation on intermediary metabolite homeostasis of marine bivalves Mytilus edulis and Crassostrea gigas	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												Marine benthic invertebrates are frequently exposed to fluctuating oxygen levels resulting in hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) stress in the intertidal, estuarine and shallow coastal habitats. H/R stress can strongly affect the organisms' physiological performance due to the negative shifts in bioenergetics and redox balance. H/R stress commonly leads to the depletion of energy substrates and accumulation of anaerobic end products, but the effects of H/R stress on the homeostasis of the intermediate nitrogenous compounds are not well understood. We studied the effects of the short-term and long-term hypoxia (1 and 6 days, respectively) and subsequent reoxygenation on the metabolite profiles of free amino acids (FAAs), as well as the intermediates of the urea cycle and purine metabolism in two species of hypoxia-tolerant intertidal bivalves, the blue mussels Mytilus edulis and the Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas. Accumulation of succinate was assessed to determine the role of anaerobiosis in the metabolic responses to H/R stress. Our study showed that the more hypoxia-tolerant of the two studied species (C. gigas) had lower rate of succinate accumulation during hypoxia (indicating stronger metabolic rate suppression) and was better able to maintain the homeostasis of nitrogenous intermediates during H/R stress compared with the less hypoxia-tolerant M. edulis. Furthermore, analysis of the metabolite profiles indicate that the oysters maintain high levels of cytoprotective compounds (such as taurine and GABA), accumulate lower levels of potential prooxidants (such as succinate and hypoxanthine) and experience less damage to oxidation-prone thiol-containing amino acids such as cysteine, homocysteine and methionine during hypoxia and reoxygenation compared with the blue mussels. This study indicates a potentially important role of intermediate metabolite homeostasis in the tolerance to prolonged hypoxia and H/R stress in marine organisms and opens avenue for further testing of this hypothesis in a broader comparative framework.

Objective: To describe the use of ETF in a large cohort of patients with IMDs. Design: A retrospective analysis of ETF in patients with urea cycle disorders (UCDs), organic aciduria (OA), maple syrup disease (MSUD), glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) or fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAODs) diagnosed before the age of 12 months. Setting: The reference center for IMDs at Necker Hospital (Paris, France). Results: 190 patients born between January 1991 and August 2017 were being treated for OA (n = 60), UCDs (n = 55), MSUD (n = 32), GSDs (n = 26) or FAODs (n = 17). Ninety-eight of these patients (52%) received ETF (OA subgroup: n = 40 (67%); UCDs: n =12 (22%); MSUD: n = 9 (28%); GSDs: n = 23 (88%); FAODs: n = 14 (82%)). Indications for ETF were feeding difficulties in 64 (65%) patients, cessation of fasting in 39 (40%), and recurrent metabolic decompensation in 14 (14%). Complications of ETF were recorded in 48% of cases, more frequently with nasogastric tube (NGT) than with gastrostomy. Among patients in whom ETF was withdrawn, the mean duration of ETF was 5.9 (SD: 4.8) years (range: 0.6-19.8 years). The duration of ETF was found to vary from one disease subgroup to another = 0.051). While the longest median duration was found in the GSD subgroup (6.8 years), the shortest one was found in the UCD subgroup (0.9 years). Conclusion: ETF is an integral part of the dietary management of IMDs. The long duration of ETF and the specific risks of NGT highlights the potential value of gastrostomy. In this study at a French tertiary hospital, we documented the indications, modalities, duration and complications of enteral tube feeding in a cohort of patients with inherited metabolic diseases.

Therefore, herbicides targeting AHAS have the advantages of low application rate, wide herbicide spectrum and low animal toxicity, and have been widely used. However, due to overuse by farmers, a large number of drug-resistant weeds have been reported, thus it is an urgent need to develop new AHAS inhibitor herbicides. In this paper, the urea bridge of the Sulfonylurea herbicides was replaced with an amide bridge, and a total of 25 compounds were prepared by modifying the structures on both sides of the amide bridge. The target compounds could be rapidly prepared by the amide formation reaction, thioether formation and oxidation route with moderate to high yields, and their structures were characterized by 1 H and 13 C NMR and HRMS. The inhibitory activities of these compounds against AHAS were tested in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro inhibition rates of compounds Y-1 to Y-8 and Y-21 were higher than chlorsulfuron (CS) (88.70%) at 10 mu M under the otherwise identic conditions. And the in vitro inhibition rates of compounds Y-1, Y-3, Y-4 and Y-5 were higher than Bensulfuron-methyl (BSM) (94.80%). The IC50 of Y-5 was the lowest at 0.03 mu M, which was 1/4 of the IC50 of BSM and 1/24 of the IC50 of CS. Finally, it was found that compounds Y-4, Y-8 and Y-21 had higher inhibition rates against chlorella growth than BSM (75.10%) and CS (71.80%), and Y-1, Y-3, Y-5 and Y-8 showed strong inhibitory effects on the root growth of Arabidopsis. Compounds Y-3 and Y-5 can inhibit the growth of Abutilon theophrasti and Echinochloa crus-galli, respectively, in green house.

However, the role of renal Bmal1 in chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains poorly understood. Here by generating mice lacking Bmal1 in proximal tubule (Bmal1flox/flox-KAP-Cre+, ptKO) and inducing CKD with the adenine diet model, we found that lack of Bmal1 in proximal tubule did not alter renal water and electrolyte homeostasis. However, adenine-induced renal injury indexes, including blood urea ni-trogen, serum creatinine, and proteinuria, were markedly augmented in the ptKO mice. The ptKO kidneys also developed aggravated tubulointerstitial fibrosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation. Mechanistically, RNAseq analysis revealed significant downregulation of the expression of genes related to energy and substance metabolism, in particular fatty acid oxidation and glutathione/homocysteine metabolism, in the ptKO kidneys. Consistently, the renal contents of ATP and glutathione were markedly reduced in the ptKO mice, suggesting the disruption of cellular metabolic homeostasis. Moreover, we demonstrated that Bmal1 can activate the tran-scription of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), a key enzyme for homocysteine metabolism and glutathione biosynthesis, through direct recruitment to the E-box motifs of its promoter. Supporting the in vivo findings, knockdown of Bmal1 in cultured proximal tubular cells inhibited CBS expression and amplified albumin-induced cell injury and fibrogenesis, while glutathione supplementation remarkably reversed these changes. Taken together, we concluded that deletion of Bmal1 in proximal tubule may aggravate chronic kidney injury and exacerbate renal fibrosis, the mechanism is related to suppressing CBS transcription and disturbing glutathione related metabolic homeostasis. These findings suggest a protective role of Bmal1 in chronic tubular injury and offer a novel target for treating CKD.

However, the effects of high plant protein (HPP) intake on glycaemic responses and hepatic lipid metabolism in healthy people, as well as the underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. The current study explored the metabolomic and transcriptomic responses in the livers of pigs to assess the effects of HPP intake on host glucose and lipid metabolism. Sixteen pigs were infused with sterile saline or soy protein hydrolysate (SPH; 70 g/day) through a duodenal fistula twice daily during a 15 days experimental period. Hepatic metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed, and the serum and hepatic biochemical parameters were measured. The results revealed that SPH infusion decreased serum glucose, hepatic triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, while it increased serum urea and eight hepatic amino acid levels (P < 0.05). Hepatic metabolomics displayed that SPH treatment produced seven different metabolites, four of which were related to lipid metabolism and one was related to glucose metabolism. In particular, lower (P < 0.05) glycocholic acid and glucose 1-phosphate levels and higher (P < 0.05) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), arachidonic acid, prostaglandin F2 alpha, l-carnitine and indole-3 acetic acid levels were observed following SPH infusion. A further metabolic pathway enrichment analysis found that these differential metabolites were mainly enriched in pathways related to lipid and glucose metabolism. Hepatic transcriptomics also demonstrated that multiple genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism were affected by SPH (P < 0.05). Together, SPH infusion reduced the hepatic TG levels by accelerating fatty acid beta-oxidation and inhibiting TG synthesis. In addition, SPH infusion reduced the serum glucose levels by promoting hepatic glucose uptake and glycolysis. This study's result demonstrated that HPP intake regulated glycaemic responses and hepatic lipid metabolism in pigs without increasing the risk of hepatic lipid deposition and hyperglycaemia.						hang, suqin/0000-0002-8191-7480; Zhu, Weiyun/0000-0001-9222-6581													2296-861X					APR 26	2022	9								838617	10.3389/fnut.2022.838617	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.838617								35558750					WOS:000805950800001

However, the mechanism of N-stress-driven photoinhibition of the photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) is still unclear in the N-sensitive species such as Panax notoginseng, and thus the role of electron transport in PSII and PSI photoinhibition needs to be further understood. We comparatively analyzed photosystem activity, photosynthetic rate, excitation energy distribution, electron transport, OJIP kinetic curve, P700 dark reduction, and antioxidant enzyme activities in low N (LN), moderate N (MN), and high N (HN) leaves treated with linear electron flow (LEF) inhibitor [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea (DCMU)] and cyclic electron flow (CEF) inhibitor (methyl viologen, MV). The results showed that the increased application of N fertilizer significantly enhance leaf N contents and specific leaf N (SLN). Net photosynthetic rate (P-n) was lower in HN and LN plants than in MN ones. Maximum photochemistry efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m), maximum photo-oxidation P700(+) (P-m), electron transport rate of PSI (ETRI), electron transport rate of PSII (ETRII), and plastoquinone (PQ) pool size were lower in the LN plants. More importantly, K phase and CEF were higher in the LN plants. Additionally, there was not a significant difference in the activity of antioxidant enzyme between the MV- and H2O-treated plants. The results obtained suggest that the lower LEF leads to the hindrance of the formation of Delta pH and ATP in LN plants, thereby damaging the donor side of the PSII oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). The over-reduction of PSI acceptor side is the main cause of PSI photoinhibition under LN condition. Higher CEF and antioxidant enzyme activity not only protected PSI from photodamage but also slowed down the damage rate of PSII in P. notoginseng grown under LN.																			1664-462X					FEB 15	2022	13								796931	10.3389/fpls.2022.796931	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.796931								35242152					WOS:000771650500001

Our study aimed to identify the potential relationship within cisplatin-induced multi-organ physiological changes and genetic factors associated with sex differences in nephrotoxicity susceptibility. To investigate this, mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin. Cisplatin administration resulted in renal dysfunction, as evidenced by the elevation in serum biomarkers of renal damage (blood urea nitrogen and creatinine) and the degree of histopathological alterations. In particular, along with testicular damage and low testosterone levels, we also observed a decrease in male-specific (CYP3A2) or male-dominant (CYP2B1 and CYP3A1) CYP isoforms in the livers of rats with hepatotoxicity following cisplatin treatment, which may be associated with an imbalance in male hormone regulation caused by renal and testicular injury. Notably, we found that male rats were more susceptible to cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, as characterized by histopathological and biochemical analyses. Therefore, RNA sequencing was performed at baseline (pre-treatment) and at 48 h following cisplatin administration (post-treatment) to identify the genes associated with sex differences in nephrotoxicity susceptibility. Gap junctions, which play a role in replenishing damaged cells to maintain tissue homeostasis, and mismatch repair associated with a pathological apoptotic mechanism against cisplatin nephrotoxicity were significantly enriched only in males following cisplatin treatment. Moreover, among the 322 DEGs showing different basal expression patterns between males and females before cisplatin treatment, the male expressed high levels of genes, which are responsible for transmembrane transport and regulation of apoptotic process, pre-cisplatin treatment; additionally, genes involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and the oxidation-reduction process were significantly lower in males before cisplatin treatment. Collectively, our comprehensive findings provided valuable insight into the potential mechanisms of sex differences in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity susceptibility.

In the present work, honeycomb-like g-C3N4 was synthesized via thermal condensation of urea with addition of water at 450 degrees C for 1 h. Prolonging the condensation time caused the morphology of g-C3N4 to change from a porous honeycomb structure to a velvet-like nanoarchitecture. Unlike in previous studies, the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 decreased with increasing surface area. The honeycomb-like g-C3N4 with a relatively low surface area showed highly enhanced photocatalytic activity with an NO removal ratio of 48%. The evolution of NO2 intermediate was dramatically inhibited over the honeycomb-like g-C3N4. The short and long lifetimes of the charge carriers for honeycomb-like g-C3N4 were unprecedentedly prolonged to 22.3 and 165.4 ns, respectively. As a result, the honeycomb-like g-C3N4 was highly efficient and stable in activity and could be used repeatedly. Addition of water had the following multiple positive effects on g-C3N4: (1) formation of the honeycomb structure, (2) promotion of charge separation and migration, (3) enlargement of the band gap, (4) increase in production yield, and (5) decrease in energy cost. These advantages make the present preparation method for highly efficient g-C3N4 extremely appealing for large-scale applications. The active species produced from g-C3N4 under illumination were confirmed using DMPO-ESR spin-trapping, the reaction intermediate was monitored, and the reaction mechanism of photocatalytic NO oxidation by g-C3N4 was revealed.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified as a critical type of regulatory noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that present the important functions in various diseases. In this study, we identified a novel circRNA circTLK1 in the regulation of sepsis-induced AKI. We observed that circTLK1 expression was elevated in the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) rat model compared with that in the control rats. The urine levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) and the serum levels of creatinine (sCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were increased by the CLP treatment in the rats but were blocked by the circTLK1 shRNA. The circTLK1 shRNA reduced the CLP-induced kidney injury in the rats. The circTLK1 knockdown repressed oxidation stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the sepsis-related AKI rat model. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment increased the production of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 in the HK-2 cells, while the circTLK1 shRNA could attenuate the enhancement in the cells. Bax and cleaved caspase-3 expression was upregulated, but Bcl-2 expression was downregulated by the LPS in the HK-2 cells, in which circTLK1 depletion reversed this effect in the cells. The depletion of circTLK1 attenuated the LPS-induced apoptosis in the HK-2 cells. CircTLK1 enhanced HMGB1 expression by sponging miR-106a-5p in the HK-2 cells, and miR-106a-5p and HMGB1 were involved in circTLK1-meidated injury of LPS-treated cells. Therefore, we concluded that circTLK1 contributed to sepsis-associated AKI by regulating inflammation and oxidative stress through the miR-106a-5p/HMGB1 axis. CircTLK1 and miR-106a-5p may be employed as the potential targets for the treatment of AKI.					xu, haiping/GSJ-1374-2022															2296-889X				JUN 25	2021	8								660269	10.3389/fmolb.2021.660269	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2021.660269								34250012					WOS:000670773400001

In this work, the feasibility of CLG of HNWW is explored using a modified copper slag (CS1100) as an oxygen carrier (OC). The CS1100 sample modified by alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) was first prepared, and then the reactivity of different OCs was evaluated. The K-modified CS1100 (K-CS) sample showed the highest reactivity due to the formation of KFe2O4. Lattice oxygen was beneficial to char conversion, evidently promoting HNWW conversion. The K-CS sample showed the highest carbon conversion (74.65%) and valid gas yield (641 mL/g), followed by the Ca-CS and Na-CS samples, which exhibited a much higher carbon conversion than the inert SiO2 sample (40.45% and 327 mL/g). The K-CS sample can evidently promote the release of N and the subsequent oxidation of nitrogen-containing pollutants (i.e., NH3 and HCN), thus lowering the emissions of nitrogen pollutants. Char-N accounts for 22.54% of N during pyrolysis; however, char-N only accounts for 2.27% of N during CLG. Additionally, compared to pyrolysis, the emissions of nitrogen-containing pollutants decreased by approximately 20% in CLG. The Protein-N (N-P) and Urea-N (N-U) were decomposed to form Pyrrole-N (N-5) and Pyridine-N (N-6); and then formed Protonated pyridine N (N-Q) and Pyridine N-oxide (N-X) during thermal conversion of HNWW. Additionally, more N-X and N-6 remained in the residual char during CLG than during pyrolysis because of the presence of active OC. KFe2O4 acted as a catalyst rather than an oxidizer during CLG, and the K-CS sample can act as an OC for recycling.					li, haibin/A-1012-2012; Wang, Xiaobo/AAD-5858-2019; Dong, Nanhang/AAL-1297-2021; Huang, Zhen/AAS-9805-2020; wang, hao/AAX-7912-2021; Chang, Guozhang/HJA-5095-2022	Dong, Nanhang/0000-0002-2333-8894; Lin, Yan/0000-0002-4719-0046													1385-8947	1873-3212				APR 15	2021	410								128344	10.1016/j.cej.2020.128344	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.128344		JAN 2021											WOS:000626520100005

Fipronil has been banned from agricultural use in China since 2009, but its residue remains in the environment. Therefore, an efficient and economical method is urgently needed to degrade fipronil residues in the environment. Herein, the degradation of fipronil in water solution using argon microwave-induced plasma (MIP) system was studied and a plausible reaction pathway was proposed in combination with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The degradation of fipronil by MIP system was optimized in terms of input power, plasma-sample distance, initial concentration and gas flow rate. After short time MIP treatment with an input power of 150 W, as high as 85.62% degradation efficiency was achieved for the fipronil at concentration of 20 mg.L-1 under the optimized conditions, and the corresponding energy efficiency was 1334.8 mg.kwh(-1). Optical emission spectrometry (OES) was employed to characterize the distribution and intensity of OH, H and O species which play key roles in the degradation of fipronil by plasma, and it revealed that the degradation reaction mainly occurs at gas-liquid interface where the highest intensity of OH, H and O species was observed. High resolution mass spectrometric analysis in combination quantum chemical calculations indicate that a wide diversity of reaction processes occurred for fipronil degradation under MIP treatment, involving oxidation or reduction, nitro reduction, oxidative dichlorination, reductive dichlorination, hydration, dehydration and thiourea to urea. The possible degradation mechanism and pathways were proposed based on the degrading species identified by high resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) and the thermodynamic profiles.

Mainly aimed at the treatment of moderate to severe pain, these drugs are extensively prescribed for multiple clinical applications. Along with the increase in their use, there has been an increment in their abuse, and consequently in the reported number of adverse reactions and intoxications. However, little is known about their mechanisms of toxicity. In this study, we have analyzed the in vivo toxicological effects in liver and kidney resulting from an acute exposure of a rodent animal model to both opioids. Male Wistar rats were intraperitoneally administered with 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg tramadol and tapentadol, corresponding to a low, effective analgesic dose, an intermediate dose and the maximum recommended daily dose, respectively, for 24 h. Toxicological effects were assessed in terms of oxidative stress, biochemical and metabolic parameters and histopathology, using serum and urine samples, liver and kidney homogenates and tissue specimens. The acute exposure to tapentadol caused a dose-dependent increase in protein oxidation in liver and kidney. Additionally, exposure to both opioids led to hepatic commitment, as shown by increased serum lipid levels, decreased urea concentration, increased alanine aminotransferase and decreased butyrylcholinesterase activities. It also led to renal impairment, as reflected by proteinuria and decreased glomerular filtration rate. Histopathological findings included sinusoidal dilatation, microsteatosis, vacuolization, cell infiltrates and cell degeneration, indicating metabolic changes, inflammation and cell damage. In conclusion, a single effective analgesic dose or the maximum recommended daily dose of both opioids leads to hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, with tapentadol inducing comparatively more toxicity. Whether these effects reflect risks during the therapeutic use or human overdoses requires focused attention by the medical community.

These disorders include aminoacidopathies, urea cycle defects, organic acidemias, defects of oxidation of fatty acids, and lysosomal storage diseases. Inborn errors of metabolism constitute a significant proportion of genetic diseases, particularly in children; however, they are individually rare. Clinical phenotypes are very variable, some of them remain asymptomatic, others manifest metabolic decompensation in neonatal age, and others encompass mental retardation at later age. The clinical manifestation of these disorders can involve different organs and/or systems. Some disorders are easily managed if promptly diagnosed and treated, whereas in other cases neither diet, vitamin therapy, nor transplantation appears to prevent multi-organ impairment. Summary: Here, we discuss the principal challenges of metabolomics and proteomics in inherited metabolic disorders. We review the recent developments in mass spectrometry-based proteomic and metabolomic strategies. Mass spectrometry has become the most widely used platform in proteomics and metabolomics because of its ability to analyze a wide range of molecules, its optimal dynamic range, and great sensitivity. The fast measurement of a broad spectrum of metabolites in various body fluids, also collected in small samples like dried blood spots, have been facilitated by the use of mass spectrometry-based techniques. These approaches have enabled the timely diagnosis of inherited metabolic disorders, thereby facilitating early therapeutic intervention. Due to its analytical features, proteomics is suited for the basic investigation of inborn errors of metabolism. Modern approaches enable detailed functional characterization of the pathogenic biochemical processes, as achieved by quantification of proteins and identification of their regulatory chemical modifications. Key Message: Mass spectrometry-based "omics" approaches most frequently used to study the molecular mechanisms underlying inherited metabolic disorders pathophysiology are described. (c) 2017 S.

However, its effects on renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) remain to be elucidated. The present study aimed to examine the effects of honokiol on renal IRI, and to investigate its potential protective mechanisms in the heart. Male adult Wistar albino rats were induced into a renal IRI model. Subsequently, the levels of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and the levels of serum nitrite and the kidney nitrite were examined in the IRI group. The levels of oxidative stress, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), inflammatory factors and caspase-3 were evaluated using a series of commercially available kits. The levels of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) and the protein expression levels of STAT3 were determined using western blotting. Pretreatment with honokiol significantly reduced the levels of serum creatinine, BUN, ALT, AST and ALP, and the level of nitrite in the kidney of the IRI group, compared with the control group. The levels of malondialdehyde, the activity of myeloperoxidase, and the gene expression and activity of iNOS were reduced in the IRI rats, compared with the sham-operated rats, whereas the levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase were increased following treatment with honokiol in the IRI rats. In addition, the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-6 in the IRI rats were increased by honokiol. Treatment with honokiol suppressed the protein expression levels of p-STAT3 and caspase-3 in the IRI rats. These findings indicated that honokiol protects against renal IRI via the suppression of oxidative stress, iNOS, inflammation and STAT3 in the rat.																			1791-2997	1791-3004				FEB	2016	13	2					1353	1360		10.3892/mmr.2015.4660	http://dx.doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2015.4660								26647858					WOS:000369553700040
J	Ren, ML; Wang, JJ				Ren, Minglei; Wang, Jianjun			Phylogenetic divergence and adaptation of Nitrososphaeria across lake depths and freshwater ecosystems	ISME JOURNAL												Thaumarchaeota (now the class Nitrososphaeria in the phylum Thermoproteota in GTDB taxonomy) are abundant across marine and soil habitats; however, their genomic diversity and evolutionary history in freshwater environments remain elusive. Here, we reconstructed 17 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes of Nitrososphaeria from a deep lake and two great rivers, and compared all available genomes between freshwater and marine habitats regarding their phylogenetic positions, relative abundance, and genomic content. We found that freshwater Nitrososphaeria were dominated by the family Nitrosopumilaceae and could be grouped into three distinct clades closely related to the genera Nitrosopumilus, Nitrosoarchaeum, and Nitrosotenuis. The Nitrosopumilus-like clade was exclusively from deep lakes, while the Nitrosoarchaeum-like clade was dominated by species from deep lakes and rivers, and the Nitrosotenuis-like clade was mainly from rivers, deep lakes, and estuaries. Interestingly, there was vertical niche separation between two clades in deep lakes, showing that the Nitrosopumilus-like species dominated shallow layers, whereas the relative abundance of the Nitrosoarchaeum-like clade increased toward deep waters. Phylogenetic clustering patterns in the Nitrosopumilaceae supported at least one freshwater-to-marine and two marine-to-freshwater transitions, the former of which refined the potential terrestrial-to-marine evolutionary path as previously proposed. The occurrence of the two marine-to-freshwater transitions were accompanied by horizontal transfer of the genes involved in nutrition regulation, osmoregulation, and cell motility during their colonization to freshwater habitats. Specifically, the Nitrosopumilus-like clade showed losses of genes encoding flagella assembly and ion transport, whereas the Nitrosoarchaeum-like clade had losses of intact genes involved in urea uptake and utilization and gains of genes encoding osmolarity-mediated mechanosensitive channels. Collectively, our results reveal for the first time the high genomic diversity of the class Nitrososphaeria across freshwater ecosystems and provide novel insights into their adaptive mechanisms and evolutionary histories.					wang, jianjun/A-1704-2012; Ren, Minglei/MTB-4680-2025	Wang, Jianjun/0000-0001-7039-7136													1751-7362	1751-7370				JUN	2022	16	6					1491	1501		10.1038/s41396-022-01199-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41396-022-01199-7		JAN 2022						35091647					WOS:000748159000001

Combining omics with conventional techniques allows for an integrative approach to broadly explore and identify important biomolecules. Friesian horses were aquatrained (n = 5) or dry treadmill trained (n = 7) (8 weeks) and monitored for: evolution of muscle diameter in response to aquatraining and dry treadmill training, fiber type composition and fiber cross-sectional area of the M. pectoralis, M. vastus lateralis and M. semitendinosus and untargeted metabolomics of the M. pectoralis and M. vastus lateralis in response to dry treadmill training. Aquatraining was superior to dry treadmill training to increase muscle diameter in the hindquarters, with maximum effect after 4 weeks. After dry treadmill training, the M. pectoralis showed increased muscle diameter, more type I fibers, decreased fiber mean cross sectional area, and an upregulated oxidative metabolic profile: increased beta-oxidation (key metabolites: decreased long chain fatty acids and increased long chain acylcarnitines), TCA activity (intermediates including succinyl-carnitine and 2-methylcitrate), amino acid metabolism (glutamine, aromatic amino acids, serine, urea cycle metabolites such as proline, arginine and ornithine) and xenobiotic metabolism (especially p-cresol glucuronide). The M. vastus lateralis expanded its fast twitch profile, with decreased muscle diameter, type I fibers and an upregulation of glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway activity, and increased branched-chain and aromatic amino acid metabolism (cis-urocanate, carnosine, homocarnosine, tyrosine, tryptophan, p-cresol-glucuronide, serine, methionine, cysteine, proline and ornithine). Trained Friesians showed increased collagen and elastin turn-over. Results show that branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids and microbiome-derived xenobiotics need further study in horses. They feed the TCA cycle at steps further downstream from acetyl CoA and most likely, they are oxidized in type IIA fibers, the predominant fiber type of the horse. These study results underline the importance of reviewing existing paradigms on equine bioenergetics.

In the present study, CKD was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy and the animals were divided into four treatment groups as follows: control (C), CKD, CKD+allicin (40 mg/kg pathway oral) (CKDA), and CKD+Losartan (20 mg/kg) (CKDL). After CKD induction, the rats developed hypertension from week 3 to the end of the study. This was associated with increased creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in serum, increased albuminuria, increased urinary excretion of N-acetyl--d-glucosaminidase (NAG), increased nephrin expression, and incrased histological alterations in the cortex. The levels of angiotensin receptors and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were decreased in the renal cortex from the CKD group. Otherwise, lipid and protein oxidation were higher in the CKD group than in the control group. A disturbance was observed in the expression levels of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/Kelch ECH associating protein 1 system (Nrf2/keap1) and the antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and heme oxygenase-1. Allicin or losartan treatments relieved renal dysfunction, hypertension, and oxidative stress. In addition, both treatments showed the same efficacy on the expression of angiotensin receptors, the nephrin, Nrf2/keap1 pathway, and eNOS. Further in silico analyses suggest that allicin and losartan could have a common mechanism involving interaction with AT1 receptors. Allicin showed antihypertensive, antioxidant, and nephroprotective effects. The beneficial effects showed by allicin are similar, or even better, than those of losartan. In fact, the effect of allicin on blood pressure and renal function is comparable to reductions seen with losartan, a prescription drug commonly used as a first-line therapy.

Acanthamoeba, in immunocompetent patients, may cause a keratitis related to corneal microtrauma. These free-living amoebas easily adapt to the host environment and wield metabolic pathways such as the energetic and respiratory ones in order to maintain viability for long periods. The energetic metabolism of cysts and trophozoites remains mostly unknown. There are a few reports on the energetic metabolism of these organisms as they are mitochondriate eukaryotes and some studies under aerobic conditions showing that Acanthamoeba hydrolyzes glucose into pyruvate via glycolysis. The aim of this study was to detect the energetic metabolic pathways with emphasis on anaerobic metabolism in trophozoites of three isolates of Acanthamoeba sp belonging to the T4 genotype. Two samples were collected in the environment and one was a clinical sample. The evaluation of these microorganisms proceeded as follows: rupture of trophozoites (7.5 x 10(3) parasites/ml) and biochemical analysis with high performance liquid chromatography and spectrophotometry. The anaerobic glycolysis was identified through the detection of glucose, pyruvate, and lactate. The protein catabolism was identified through the detection of fumarate, urea, and creatinine. The fatty acid oxidation was identified through the detection of acetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and propionate. The detected substances are the result of the consumption of energy reserves such as glycogen and lipids. The anaerobic glycolysis and protein catabolism pathways were observed in all three isolates: one clinical and two environmental.

Although amebiasis is usually asymptomatic, E. histolytica has potent pathogenic potential. During host infection, the parasite is exposed to reactive oxygen species that are produced and released by cells of the innate immune system at the site of infection. The ability of the parasite to survive oxidative stress (OS) is essential for a successful invasion of the host. Although the effects of OS on the regulation of gene expression in E. histolytica and the characterization of some proteins whose function in the parasite's defense against OS have been previously studied, our knowledge of oxidized proteins in E. histolytica is lacking. In order to fill this knowledge gap, we performed a large-scale identification and quantification of the oxidized proteins in oxidatively stressed E. histolytica trophozoites using resin-assisted capture coupled to mass spectrometry. We detected 154 oxidized proteins (OXs) and the functions of some of these proteins were associated with antioxidant activity, maintaining the parasite's cytoskeleton, translation, catalysis, and transport. We also found that oxidation of the Gal/GalNAc impairs its function and contributes to the inhibition of E. histolytica adherence to host cells. We also provide evidence that arginase, an enzyme which converts L-arginine into L-ornithine and urea, is involved in the protection of the parasite against OS. Collectively, these results emphasize the importance of OS as a critical regulator of E. histolytica's functions and indicate a new role for arginase in E. histolytica's resistance to OS.

Combining SQFZ with conventional chemotherapy may improve the therapeutic efficacy and reduce side-effects of chemotherapy. However, the mechanisms of SQFZ reducing cisplatin-induced kidney injury are still unclear. Methods: The main compounds of SQFZ were identified via UPLC-Q-TOF-MS technique. Using multiple databases to predict potential targets for SQFZ. We established a breast cancer model by injecting 4T1 cells into mice. Tumor growth and body weight were observed. Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (CRE), and glutathione (GSH) levels were measured. The extent of their kidney injury was measured by hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE). Cell apoptosis was identified using Hoechst33258 staining, flow cytometry and TUNEL. We evaluated H2AX and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and assessed apoptosis-associated proteins by Western blotting analysis. We also evaluated mitochondrial function. The secretion of the inflammatory cytokines in serum was observed using ELISA assay. The effect of the STING pathway in HK-2 renal tubular epithelial cells exposed to cisplatin alone or combined with SQFZ. Results: The potential targets of SQFZ on kidney injury mainly related to inflammatory responses, oxidation and antioxidant, apoptosis as well as IFN signaling pathway. Cisplatin significantly reduced animal weight, while there were no changes in the combination SQFZ and cisplatin. SQFZ counteracted cisplatin-induced BUN and CRE elevation. SQFZ ameliorated the oxidative stress induced by cisplatin. It diminished cisplatin-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial DNA damage and reversed cisplatin-induced cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS)/STING signaling pathway activation. It also improved the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by cisplatin. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggested that SQFZ effectively reduced cisplatin-induced kidney injury by inhibiting cGAS/STING signaling pathway.

Thermal conditioning in chickens in the neonatal period can improve thermotolerance and reduce body temperature increases when birds are exposed to high ambient temperature later in life. The objective of this study was to investigate physiological and molecular changes associated with heat production and hence body temperature regulation under high ambient temperatures in thermally conditioned chicks. Three-day-old broiler chicks (Chunky) were thermally conditioned by exposure to a high ambient temperature (40 degrees C) for 12 h while control chicks were kept at 30 degrees C. Four days after the treatment, both groups were exposed to 40 degrees C for 15 or 90 min. The increase in rectal temperature during 90 min of exposure to a high ambient temperature was less in thermally conditioned than control chicks. At 15-min of re-exposure treatment, gene expression for uncoupling protein and carnitine palmitoyletransferase 1, key molecules in thermogenesis and fatty acid oxidation, were significantly higher in pectoral muscle of control chicks but not conditioned chicks. Hepatic argininosuccinate synthase (ASS) decreased and hepatic argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) increased after reexposure to a high temperature. The concentrations of hepatic arginosuccinic acid, and ASS and ASL expression, were upregulated in conditioned chicks compared with the control chicks, indicating activity of the urea cycle could be enhanced to trap more energy to reduce heat production in conditioned chicks. These results suggest thermal conditioning can reduce the increase in heat production in muscles of chickens that occurs in high ambient temperatures to promote sensible heat loss. Conditioning may also promote energy trapping process in the liver by altering the heat production system, resulting in an alleviation of the excessive rise of body temperature.

Studies on biomarker identification after radiation exposure could aid in biodosimetry, identifying individual dose absorbed, as well as biologic response, and administering immediate and proper medical care. Metabolomics on easily accessible biofluids is an emerging field with potential for high-throughput biodosimetry. While tremendous effort has been put into obtaining discovery based global radiation signatures from a number of biofluids and model organisms, quantitative targeted analysis on a subset of known radiation biomarkers is required to develop an optimized panel of biomarkers for future clinical applications. The current study analyzes levels of several known broad chemical groups (acylcarnitines, amino acids, phosphatidylcholines, and biogenic amines) affected by IR in serum from nonhuman primates (NHP) 7 days after exposure through multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis with a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (MS) platform. We identified several novel metabolites affected by IR exposure through univariate and unsupervised multivariate analyses. Levels of acylcarnitines, amino acids, and phospholipids were perturbed indicating altered protein metabolism, fatty acid b-oxidation, and inflammation. Fold changes in carnitine and short-chain acylcarnitines (acetylcarnitine, propionylcarnitine, butyrylcarnitine, and valerylcarnitine) complement previous global radiation signatures on NHP; notably, the levels of change were lower than previously observed in urine. Decreased levels of glutamate, citrulline, and arginine after IR are biomarkers indicating gastrointestinal syndrome and perturbations to the urea cycle. Sex differences were also assessed and were more prevalent in circulating acylcarnitines and phospholipids after IR exposure. These biomarkers may be combined with previously described compounds from DNA damage to develop a defined metabolomic biodosimetry panel to be analyzed by MS platforms, which are increasingly available in clinical laboratories.

Therefore, Cu-Mn spinel oxide nanospheres anchored N-doped carbon (CMO/NC) was prepared by a one-step calcination method and used to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for efficient mineralization of bisphenol A (BPA). With the use of 0.5 g/L CMO/NC and 0.2 g/L PMS, the added BPA (50 mg/L) was completely degraded and deeply mineralized (nearly 95.2 %) in 9 min. The apparent first-order degradation rate constant k was 0.557 min(-1), which was 61.9, 6.2 and 2.5 times than those in the systems of N-C/PMS (0.009 min(-1)), CuO/NC/PMS (0.09 min(-1)) and Mn3O4/NC/PMS (0.22 min(-1)). A comparison between the catalytic performances of CMO/NC catalysts prepared by changing the dosage of urea confirmed the catalysis synergism between Cu-Mn spinel oxides and N-C. A further comparison between the catalytic performances of CMO/NC catalysts prepared by varying the Cu/Mn molar ratio of the precursors showed that the synergy between Cu and Mn sites promoted the catalytic activity, with a synergistic effect factor of 1.8. XPS and H-2-TPR characterizations proved that strong Cu-Mn interaction caused Mn species easier to donate electrons to PMS and Cu species easier to accept electrons from PMS. The degradation pathway and intermediate toxicity suggested that the system did not produce secondary pollution. Based on the results of EPR and capture experiments confirming that O-1(2) was the major active species, a mechanism on PMS activation was proposed. Through investigations of continuous flow BPA wastewater removal, the influence of coexisting anions and catalyst cycling stability, it was clearly demonstrated that the present system had broad application prospects.					wu, xiaoyong/AGS-3112-2022; Zhu, Wenjun/KYQ-8142-2024; Wang, Nan/G-8447-2013														1385-8947	1873-3212				OCT 1	2024	497								154687	10.1016/j.cej.2024.154687	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.154687		AUG 2024											WOS:001296929800001

This process requires an efficient electrocatalyst with high faradaic efficiency at low overpotential and enhanced reaction rate. Herein, we report an innovative way of reducing CO2 using copper-metal supported on titanium oxide nanotubes (TNT) electrocatalysts. The TNT support material was synthesized using alkaline hydrothermal process with Degussa (P-25) as a starting material. Copper nanoparticles were anchored on the TNT by homogeneous deposition-precipitation method (HDP) with urea as precipitating agent. The prepared catalysts were tested in a home-made H-cell with 0.5 M NaHCO3 aqueous solution in order to examine their activity for ERC and the optimum copper loading. Continuous gas-phase ERC was carried out in a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) reactor. The 10% Cu/TNT catalysts were employed in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) on the cathode side with Pt-Ru/C on the anode side. Faradaic efficiencies for the three major products namely methanol, methane, and CO were found to be 4%, 3%, and 10%, respectively at -2.5 V with an overall current density of 120 mA/cm(2). The addition of TNT significantly increased the catalytic activity of electrocatalyst for ERC. It is mainly attributed to their better stability towards oxidation, increased CO2 adsorption capacity and stabilization of the reaction intermediate, layered titanates, and larger surface area (400 m(2)/g) as compared with other support materials. Considering the low cost of TNT, it is anticipated that TNT support electrocatalyst for ECR will gain popularity.

Soybean fallow and nitrification inhibitors: Strategies to reduce N2O emission intensities and N losses in Australian sugarcane cropping systems	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The Australian sugar industry is facing mounting pressure to reduce the nitrogen (N) losses and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions associated with N fertiliser use. Research has shown that N2O emissions from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) cropping systems can be reduced with the use of fertilisers coated with nitrification inhibitors, or by sowing legume crops in the fallows between sugarcane crop cycles. However, the efficacy of these two N management strategies across different climatic zones is still unclear, as results from field studies have been contradictory. The objectives of this study were therefore to use the DayCent model to assess the long-term effects of the two strategies (separately or in combination) on N2O emissions, N losses and yields. The model was parameterised using data from eight field experiments (39 treatments) conducted across four of the five main districts of the Australian sugarcane industry. A series of long-term scenarios embracing a range of N fertiliser rates (0-160 kg N ha(-1) applied as urea), climatic regions (Tropics and Subtropics), soil textures (fineand coarse-textured soils) and N-loss risk scenarios (crop fertilised well before or close to the on-set of the wet season) were tested for both N management strategies. Simulations identified that the combined use of soybean (Glycine max L.) fallows and N fertiliser coated with the 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) nitrification inhibitor was the most effective strategy to maintain or even increase current yields while significantly reducing N2O and cumulative N (mainly due to nitrate) losses. When used alone, the soybean fallow strategy on average reduced N losses over the entire crop cycle by 29 % compared with current industry best practice. However, this strategy showed a limited capacity to reduce N2O emissions over the entire cane crop cycle (median:-3% compared with current industry best practice), or even increased them in scenarios at high-risk of N losses in the Tropics. The use of urea coated with DMPP alone allowed current fertiliser N rates to be reduced by 30 % without any substantial yield penalty. In environments prone to high N losses, DMPP urea abated overall N losses and N2O emissions by 41 % and 30 %, respectively. This was the first study to use such an extensive dataset to parameterise a biogeochemical model for yields, N2O emissions and N losses in sugarcane cropping systems. The findings will be instrumental in guiding future research and policies designed to improve the profitability and environmental sustainability of this industry.

This study explores the effect of combining these drugs compared to that of either monotherapy. A diabetic rat model was established by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) with high-sugar content and administering a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ) via intraperitoneal injection. UA (50 mg/kg/day, po), EM (10 mg/kg/day, po) or both were administered for 8 weeks. The development of DN was determined by observing increases in urine protein, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, and uric acid and abnormal changes in kidney morphology. UA and EM either alone or in combination can alleviate the increases in blood glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin, blood lipid levels, inflammatory factors (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6), oxidation factors (SOD, MDA, GSH, CAT, NO), renal fibrosis and pro-fibrosis factors (FN, E-cad, MMP-9, TIMP-1, SMA-alpha, TGF-beta 1, SMAD, MAPK). The treatments could also ameliorate DN by preventing the abnormal proliferation of glomerular mesangial cells under high-glucose conditions, aberrant apoptosis and excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, UA reduces the increase in LDL-L, reverses abnormal bladder morphology and mitigates the increase in colony count caused by EM, and the combination treatment can overcome the disadvantages of the slow hypoglycaemic effect of UA. In short, UA combined with empagliflozin is more effective than either monotherapy in the treatment of DN and can cancel the adverse effects of each other. The protective effect of this regimen on the kidney may be related to reducing inflammation, oxidative stress and renal fibrosis.					wu, xiaohan/JLL-8682-2023; Li, Xiaotian/LIG-2344-2024; guo, hui/KRO-5200-2024														0753-3322	1950-6007				DEC	2021	144								112267	10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112267		OCT 2021						34624679					WOS:000712647700001

Further studies to identify serum biomarkers that reflect changes in sheep health and nutritional status following overgrazing would be beneficial. We hereby hypothesize that reduced sheep growth performance under overgrazing conditions would be associated with metabolic and immune response alterations. This study used an untargeted metabolomics analysis by conducting ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS) of sheep serum under overgrazing and light grazing conditions to identify metabolic disruptions in response to overgrazing. Results: The sheep body weight gains as well as serum biochemical variables associated with immune responses and nutritional metabolism (immunoglobulin G, albumin, glucose, and nonesterified fatty acids) were significantly decreased with overgrazing compared with light grazing condition. In contrast, other serum parameters such as alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, and interleukin-8 were markedly higher in the overgrazing group. Principal component analysis discriminated the metabolomes of the light grazing from the overgrazing group. Multivariate and univariate analyses revealed changes in the serum concentrations of 15 metabolites (9 metabolites exhibited a marked increase, whereas 6 metabolites showed a significant decrease) in the overgrazing group. Major changes of fatty acid oxidation, bile acid biosynthesis, and purine and protein metabolism were observed. Conclusions: These findings offer metabolic evidence for putative biomarkers for overgrazing-induced changes in serum metabolism. Target-identification of these particular metabolites may potentially increase our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of altered immune responses, nutritional metabolism, and reduced sheep growth performance under overgrazing conditions.

In this study, we utilized a flower-like WO3 in-situ generated on tungsten foil (WO3/W), and then doped with a CN layer by immersing it in urea solution and then undergoing calcination (CN-WO3/W), to degrade PFOA and generate electricity. The growth mechanism of WO3/W with different morphologies prepared under various experimental conditions was analyzed in order to explain the reasons for the superior performance of the flower-like structure compared to other morphologies. Under the irradiation of simulated sun-light, the power density reached its peak at 0.11 mW/cm2 when current density was 0.14 mA/cm2 with PFOA as fuel. CNWO3/W displayed a steady state photocurrent density of 6.1 mA/cm2 at 1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under simulated sunlight irradiation and a high PFOA degradation of 95 %, which is much higher than that of WO3/W. Due to distinctive flower-like structure, stable W-N-C bond, narrower energy band (from 2.67 to 2.41 eV), more acquisition of visible light, and strong oxidation capability, the CN-WO3/W exhibited high stability and reusability for simultaneous PEC degradation of PFOA (almost unchanged after 9 cycles) and electricity generation (without activity loss during the 24 h test) under simulated sun-light irradiation. Based on the scavengerquenching experiments the possible degradation pathways of PFOA were suggested. This work provides a way to design and synthesize the photoanode to construct reaction system for high-performance photocatalytic PFOA degradation and electricity generation.

Effects of Rocket Seed Oil, Wheat Germ Oil, and Their Mixture on Growth Performance, Feed Utilization, Digestibility, Redox Status, and Meat Fatty Acid Profile of Growing Rabbits	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												Vegetable oils are a source of natural antioxidants, including tocopherols, sterols, phenolic compounds, coenzymes, and polyunsaturated fatty acids that provide nutritional value, organoleptic properties, and significantly delay or prevent lipid oxidation. Eighty-four V-line rabbits at 5 weeks of age with an initial body weight (BW) of 535.60 +/- 13.48 g were assigned randomly to four experimental groups (seven replicates in each group with three rabbits each). The first group served as a control and received 0.3 mL/kg BW of distilled water (CON), while the second and third groups received 0.3 mL/kg BW of rocket seed oil (RSO) and wheat germ oil (WGO), respectively. The fourth group received a mixture of oils consisting of 0.15 mL of RSO and 0.15 mL of WGO/kg BW (MOs). The experiment lasted 7 weeks. The study investigated the effects of RSO, WGO, and their mixture on growth performance, feed utilization, antioxidant status, and immune response of growing rabbits. The results indicated that the rabbits that were administered orally with RSO and WGO or their mixture had higher (p <= 0.05) final BW, weight gain, and average daily gain when compared to the control group. In addition, the feed conversion ratio improved significantly with RSO, WGO, and MOs treatments. Different oil treatments improved nutrient digestibility, nutritive value, and nitrogen balance. Moreover, the rabbits that received RSO, WGO, and their mixture had an improvement the meat fatty acid composition compared to the control rabbits. Oral administration of RSO, WGO, and their mixture significantly improved serum protein fractions, decreased blood urea nitrogen, and had a positive effect on serum total lipids, HDL-c, and LDL-c. Furthermore, the treatments of RSO, WGO, and MOs had a significant improvement in the antioxidative status and immune response.

Phytochemical screening was carried out using the LC-MS procedure. The ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange (FOX) assay was used to determine the 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) inhibitory activity of the plant samples. The tetrazolium-based colorimetric (MTT) assay was performed using Vero cells. The Ames test was carried out using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 tester strains. LC-MS chromatogram of D. multiflora led to the identification of four known compounds, namely, 5-(3,5-dinitrophenyl)-2H-tetrazol (2), 2,2'-{[2-(6-amino-9H-purine-9-yl)ethyl]imino}diethanol (14), 1,2,5-oxadiazolo [3,4-b]pyrazine, 5,6-di (3,5-dimethyl-1-piperidyl) (19), and nimbolinin D (20) while four compounds were also identified in P. pinnata known as 2-hydroxycarbamoyl-4-methyl-pentanoic acid (2), pheophorbide A (16), 1-[4-({2-[(1-methyl-1H-indol-5-yl)amino]-4-pyrimidinyl}oxy)-1-naphthyl]-3-[1-(4 methylphenyl)-3-(2-methyl-2-propanyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]urea (17), and nimbolinin D (18). D. multiflora and P. pinnata inhibited 15-LOX activity in concentration-dependent manner. The LC50 (concentration that kills 50% of cells) values of the extracts ranged from 0.13 +/- 00 to 1 +/- 00 mg/mL for P. pinnata and D. multiflora, respectively. P. pinnata was cytotoxic at concentrations tested while D. multiflora was not. The selectivity index (SI) values ranged from 0.16 to 10.30 on Vero cell lines. No genotoxic effect was observed against both strains tested. These extracts are sources of compounds which can be used to control infectious diseases and associated inflammation. However, caution should be taken while using P. pinnata for medicinal purposes.

The present investigation is therefore, devoted to design a detailed experimental work to synthesize low cost and improved low-temperature SCR activity of MnCo2O4 catalyst by comparing preparation methods, calcination strategies and using different reductants in a wide range of temperature 50-450 degrees C. The catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation (CP) and nanocasting (NC) methods. For selection of the best catalyst, its precursor was calcined in stagnant air, flowing air and under reactive calcination (RC) in CO-air mixture. The SCR of NO was studied using various reductants (H-2, LPG and H-2-LPG) in a tubular reactor under the following conditions: 200 mg catalyst, 500 ppm NO, 8% O-2, 1000 ppm LPG, 1% H-2, 0.1% NH3 in Ar with a total flow rate of 100 mL/min. The inlet and outlet of the reactor were analyzed with the help of NO/NO2/NOx analyzer and gas chromatography. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, BET, SEM-EDX and FTIR. The catalyst prepared by NC method followed by RC route (Cat-R) exhibited the best NO reduction of 98.7% below 200 degrees C with H-2-LPG-SCR. The exceptionally high activity with high N-2 selectivity and good stability of Cat-R under the laboratory conditions were found. Characterization signified that the catalyst which exhibited oxygen deficient, higher surface area and the higher rate of LPG oxidation consequently have better SCR activity.

An in vitro model of Kato III cells	ACTA BIOCHIMICA POLONICA												Colonization of gastric tissue in humans by H. pylori Gram-negative bacteria initiates gastric and duodenal ulcers and even gastric cancers. Infections promote inflammation and damage to gastric epithelium which might be followed by the impairment of its barrier function. The role of H. pylori components in these processes has not been specified. H. pylori cytotoxicity may potentially increase in the milieu of anti-inflammatory drugs including acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). The lipid transport-associated molecule such as low density lipoprotein (LDL), which is a classic risk factor of coronary heart disease (CHD) and 7-ketocholesterol (7-kCh) a product of cholesterol oxidation, which may occur during the oxidative stress in LDL could also be considered as pro-inflammatory. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of H. pylori antigens, ASA, LDL and 7-kCh towards Kato III gastric epithelial cells, on the basis of the cell ability to reduce tetrazolium salt (MTT) and morphology of cell nuclei assessed by 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Kato III cells were stimulated for 24 h, at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2, with H. pylori antigens: cytotoxin associated gene A (CagA) protein, the urease A subunit (UreA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ASA, LDL or 7-kCh. H. pylori LPS, ASA, LDL and 7-kCh, but not H. pylori glycine acid extract (GE), demonstrated cytotoxicity against Kato III cells, which was related to a diminished percentage of MTT reducing cells and to an increased cell population with the signs of DNA damage. The results suggest that damage to gastric epithelial cells can be induced independently by H. pylori antigens, ASA and endogenous lipid transport-associated molecules. During H. pylori infection in vivo, especially in CHD patients, synergistic or antagonistic interactions between these factors might possibly influence the disease course. Further study is necessary to explain these potential effects.

Herein, we report one-pot solvothermal synthesis of Copper Metal-Organic Framework nanosheets modified nickel foam (Cu-MOF/NF) for electrochemical detection of transferrin (TRF) in simulated human blood serum. The crystal structure of the Cu-MOF nanosheets was determined through X-ray diffraction (XRD), while Raman spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis were employed to investigate the vibrational modes and the presence of surface OH groups, respectively. The nanosheet morphology of the Cu-MOF was observed and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs.The as-fabricated Cu-MOF/NF exhibits a sensitivity of 1.36 mA/x (x = mg.mL- 1cm- 2) for a linear range of concentrations from 1 mg mL-1 - 100 mg mL-1 with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.81 mg mL-1. The sensor exhibited good selectivity for TRF, even in the presence of interfering ions such as bovine serum albumin, ascorbic acid, uric acid, and urea, with concentrations 100-fold higher than TRF. The porous nickel foam with high conductivity, offers numerous active sites and pathways for ion transport, as well as pathways for electron transport during electrochemical catalytic reactions. This performance of the sensor is attributed to Cu 2+/Cu+ redox couple at the octahedral sites of the Cu-MOF facilitating the electro-oxidation of TRF and charge-carrier delocalization during the catalytic reaction. The as-fabricated sensor is successful in the determination of trace level TRF concentration the human blood serum with excellent recovery percentages of 108.33% This proves Cu-MOF/NF as a promising platform for various electrochemical analytical applications.

J	Zou, WX; Lang, M; Zhang, L; Liu, B; Chen, XP				Zou, Wenxin; Lang, Ming; Zhang, Ling; Liu, Bin; Chen, Xinping			Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria rather than ammonia-oxidizing archaea dominate nitrification in a nitrogen-fertilized calcareous soil	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Microbe-driven nitrification is a key process that affects nitrogen (N) utilization by plants and N loss to the environment in agro-ecosystems. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are important microorganisms that dominate the ammonia oxidation process (the first and rate-limiting step of nitrification). Calcareous soils are widely distributed, accounting for more than 30% of the Earth's land. However, the effects of long-term N fertilization on the potential nitrification rate (PNR) and on AOA and AOB in calcareous soils are poorly understood. In this study, we comprehensively assessed the effects of N application (applied at five rates as urea with 0, 73.5, 105, 136.5 and 250 kg N ha-1 for 12 years) on soil chemical characteristics, PNR, N use efficiency (NUE) and the community characteristics of AOB and AOA in a calcareous soil. N application rate affected AOB beta diversity more than that of AOA. Compared to no N control, N application significantly decreased the relative abundance of Group I.1b clade A of AOA and Nitrosospira cluster 3a.2 of AOB, but increased Nitrosomonas cluster 7 of AOB. The relative abundance of Nitrosospira cluster 3a.2 of AOB was negatively correlated with PNR. A structural equation model showed a direct effect of N application rate on the content of soil organic matter and nitrate, the alpha and beta diversity of AOA and AOB. Nitrate and AOB beta diversity were the key factors affecting PNR. Overall, the alpha, beta diversity and community composition of AOB contribute more to PNR than AOA in calcareous soils with high organic matter content. Understanding the relationship between the characteristics of AOA and AOB in calcareous soils and PNR will help to improve NUE. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

See vol. 120, 2020)	THROMBOSIS AND HAEMOSTASIS												Aim Enhancement of thromboxane A (2) (TXA (2) ) synthase (TXAS) activity, TXA (2) release, and thromboxane prostanoid (TP) receptor activation leads to vasoconstriction and oxidative injury. We explored whether genetic deletion of TXAS/TXA (2) /TP signalling may reduce renal ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in mice. Materials and Methods Renal haemodynamics and function were evaluated in TXAS (+/+) TP (+/+) (wild-type, WT), TXAS (-/-) (TXS (-/-) ), TP (-/-) and TXAS (-/-) TP (-/-) (double knockout, dKO) mice in response to intravenous TXA (2) mimetic-U46619 and 45-minute renal ischaemia and 4-hour reperfusion injury. We examined renal TXAS and TP expression, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, reactive oxygen species (ROS) amount, pro-inflammatory cytokines and pathophysiologic mechanisms, including apoptosis, autophagy and pyroptosis under I/R injury. Results Renal I/R enhanced the levels of TXAS, TP, nuclear factor-kappa B, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase gp91, Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-3/apoptosis, Beclin-1/LC3-II/autophagy, caspase-1/gasdermin D/interleukin-1 beta/pyroptosis, renal thromboxane B (2) (TXB (2) ) concentration, ROS amount, plasma BUN, creatinine and TXB (2) and decreased renal endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression in WT mice. All these enhanced parameters were significantly decreased in three KO mice. Intravenous U46619 significantly decreased renal microcirculation and enhanced gp91 and Bax/Bcl-2 in WT and TXS (-/-) but not TP (-/-) in dKO mice. I/R significantly decreased renal microcirculation in all mice; however, the time for recovery to baseline renal blood flow level was significantly shortened in TXS (-/-) , TP (-/-) and dKO mice versus WT mice. Blockade of TXAS/TP signalling attenuated I/R-enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine profile. Conclusion Blockade of TXAS/TXA (2) /TP signalling confers renal protection against I/R injury through the actions of anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, anti-autophagy and anti-pyroptosis.

In this study, biochar was prepared from simulated food waste using a hydrogel template and employed to fabricate supercapacitor electrodes. Food waste was first transformed into a soluble state through an advanced oxidation process (potassium persulfate/heat). Small-molecule polymerization was then performed to generate a structurally uniform food waste hydrogel (FWH). Urea was added during the synthesis of FWH to achieve the uniform incorporation of nitrogen into its structure. FWH biochar (FWHB) was obtained from FWH via pyrolysis at different temperatures (500, 700, and 900 degrees C). Then, we evaluated the physicochemical properties and electrochemical performances of the obtained FWHB samples. The FWHB pyrolyzed at 700 degrees C (FWHB700) exhibited a unique sponge-like microstructure with a high specific surface area of 693 m2 & BULL;g  1, which was 20 times that of untreated food waste biochar. FWHB700 also showed excellent energy storage performance, with a specific capacitance of up to 461 F & BULL;g  1 at a current density of 1 A & BULL;g  1. Based on physicochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations, the energy storage capacity of FWHB700 was found to be related to its high specific surface area, developed pore structure, as well as abundant nitrogen defects and heteroatom active sites. The symmetric FWHB700//FWHB700 supercapacitor delivered a high energy density of 9.99 Wh & BULL;kg  1 at a power density of 125 W & BULL;kg  1, with 88.2 % capacitance retention after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. In summary, this study introduces a promising electrode material for energy storage and provides a new approach for the efficient utilization of food waste resources.

On the positive side, the use of MDF has certainly reduced the level ofdeforestation. However, there is a need to develop a safe and effective treatment method for waste MDF as the presence of chemical additives in MDF and the generation of fine wood dust pose environmental and health challenges. Thermal decomposition of MDF taps into the "waste-to-energy" approach that has been broadly utilized in the disposal of organic-based wastes. Along this line of inquiry, this study entails three aims; (i) to compute thermodynamics and kinetic functions that govern the decomposition of MDF at conditions encountered at real pyrolytic and combustion conditions in waste incinerators; (ii) to acquire the temperature-dependent profiles of decomposition products; and (iii) to report ultimate and proximate analyses of MDF. Under both pyrolytic and combustion conditions, the thermal decay of MDF exhibits three stages that reflect its structural composition. Pertinent thermo-kinetic parameters were computed using model-fitting and iso-conversational formalisms. The nitrogen content in MDF peaked at 6.3%; significantly higher than that of natural wood (i.e., 1%) and originated from the use of urea formaldehyde resin. Chemical analysis indicates that nitrogenated (i.e., N , N-Dimethylacetamide) and oxygenated (i.e., catechol) products dominate the composition of the non-condensable fraction upon pyrolysis and oxidation of MDF. Such a finding calls for the importance of a post-treatment catalytic process that converts N- and O-containing products into pure hydrocarbons. The high nitrogen content in char of MDF indicates its potential utilization as soil nutrients. Values and insights reported herein are to establish a technical foundation for a biorefinery or a thermal facility that uses waste MDF as a feedstock.

Rockfish (114.25 g) were stocked into 27 cages in an offshore system and fed test diets to satiation twice daily for 8 weeks. Growth increased but feed conversion rate decreased with dietary protein increasing. Increasing dietary protein to >48 % led to reduced feeding intake but increased protein efficiency ratio. Lipid efficiency ratio increased with dietary protein increasing but decreased with dietary lipid increasing. Hepatosomatic index decreased coupling with the increases in condition factor and liver lipid content as dietary lipid increased to 14 %. Intraperitoneal fat ratio increased with dietary lipid increasing. Increasing dietary protein to > 48 % significantly elevated serum total protein and glucose concentrations, hepatic glycogen synthase activity. High-protein (52 %) diets elevated serum albumin and urea nitrogen concentrations, hepatic pyruvate kinase and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities but downregulated hepatic growth-hormone (GH) receptor. Activities of trypsin, lipase, serum superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity decreased with the dietary lipid increasing. Increasing dietary lipid to > 10 % reduced serum GH concentration, and high-lipid (14 %) diets significantly enhanced serum triglyceride concentration and hepatic transaminases activities, and resulted in a visual increase of adipocytes in liver. Serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein decreased as dietary protein increased to 48-52 % or dietary lipid >10 %. Hepatic succinate dehydrogenase activity and serum IGF-1 significantly increased while hepatic fatty acid synthetase decreased as dietary protein increased to >48 % or dietary lipid >10 %. High-protein (52 %) diet or high-lipid (14 %) diet elevated serum malonaldehyde concentration.

Ozonation products of zidovudine and thymidine in oxidative water treatment	WATER RESEARCH X												Ozonation is an advanced treatment technology that is increasingly used for the removal of organic micropollutants from wastewater and drinking water. However, reaction of organic compounds with ozone can also result in the formation of toxic transformation products. In the present study, the degradation of the antiviral drug zidovudine during ozonation was investigated. To obtain further insights into the reaction mechanisms and pathways, results of zidovudine were compared with the transformation of the naturally occurring derivative thymidine. Kinetic experiments were accompanied by elucidation of formed transformation products using lab scale batch experiments and subsequent liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis. Degradation rate constants for zidovudine with ozone in the presence of t-BuOH as radical scavenger varied between 2.8 . 10(4) M-1 s(-1) (pH 7) and 3.2 . 10(4) M-1 s(-1) (pH 3). The structural difference of zidovudine to thymidine is the exchange of the OH-moiety by the azide function at position 3'. In contrast to inorganic azide, no reaction with ozone was observed for the organic bound azide. In total, nine transformation products (TPs) were identified for both zidovudine and thymidine. Their formation can be attributed to the attack of ozone at the C-C-double bond of the pyrimidine-base. As a result of rearrangements, the primary ozonide decomposed in three pathways forming two different TPs, including hydroperoxide TPs. Rearrangement reactions followed by hydrolysis and subsequent release of H2O2 further revealed a cascade of TPs containing amide moieties. In addition, a formyl amide riboside and a urea riboside were identified as TPs indicating that oxidations of amide groups occur during ozonation processes. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A total of 102 hypertensive nephropathy patients who were admitted to our hospital from October 2015 to November 2019 were recruited and divided into a monotherapy group (MG, n=54) and a combined group (CG, n=48), in accordance with the treatment methods. Based on routine treatment, patients in the CG received treatment of tanshinone combined with valsartan, while patients in the MG received treatment of valsartan only. The clinical efficacy, adverse reactions, blood pressure, renal function indexes, vascular endothelial injury indexes, levels of inflammatory cytokines and stress response indexes of the two groups were compared. Results: After treatment, the effective rate in the CG was higher than that in the MG, and the levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and microalbumin (mAlb) in the CG were lower than those in the MG (P < 0.05). After treatment, endothelin-1 (ET-1) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) levels in the CG were lower than those in the MG, while nitric oxide (NO) level was higher than that in the MG (P < 0.05). No serious adverse reactions occurred in the two groups during treatment, with similar situations (P > 0.05). The serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), malondialdehyde (MDA) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in the CG were lower than those in the MG after treatment, while the level of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was higher (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Tanshinone combined with valsartan can treat hypertensive nephropathy safely and effectively, and reduce renal and endothelial damage by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress.																			1943-8141						2021	13	5					4788	4795											34150059					WOS:000657484200016

Micro-kinetic simulations of the catalytic decomposition of hydrazine on the Cu(111) surface	FARADAY DISCUSSIONS												Hydrazine (N2H4) is produced at industrial scale from the partial oxidation of ammonia or urea. The hydrogen content (12.5 wt%) and price of hydrazine make it a good source of hydrogen fuel, which is also easily transportable in the hydrate form, thus enabling the production of H-2 in situ. N2H4 is currently used as amonopropellant thruster to control and adjust the orbits and altitudes of spacecrafts and satellites; with similar procedures applicable in new carbon-free technologies for power generators, e.g. proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. The N2H4 decomposition is usually catalysed by the expensive Ir/Al2O3 material, but a more affordable catalyst is needed to scale-up the process whilst retaining reaction control. Using a complementary range of computational tools, including newly developed micro-kinetic simulations, we have derived and analysed the N2H4 decomposition mechanism on the Cu(111) surface, where the energetic terms of all states have been corrected by entropic terms. The simulated temperature-programmed reactions have shown how the pre-adsorbed N2H4 coverage and heating rate affect the evolution of products, including NH3, N-2 and H-2. The batch reactor simulations have revealed that for the scenario of an ideal Cu terrace, a slow but constant production of H-2 occurs, 5.4% at a temperature of 350 K, while the discharged NH3 can be recycled into N2H4. These results show that Cu(111) is not suitable for hydrogen production from hydrazine. However, real catalysts are multi-faceted and present defects, where previous work has shown a more favourable N2H4 decomposition mechanism, and, perhaps, the decomposition of NH3 improves the production of hydrogen. As such, further investigation is needed to develop a general picture.

Rice and its specialist insect pest the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens Stal (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) constitute an ideal system for studying plant-insect interactions. Objectives Combined metabolomics analyses of rice plant and BPH were conducted to understand the mechanism of host rice plant defense and BPH insect response. Methods Metabolite dynamics in rice leaf sheath and BPH honeydew was investigated using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. The GC-MS data were analyzed by principal component analysis and partial least squares-discriminant analysis. Results Twenty-six metabolites were detected in the leaf sheath extracts. Rice leaf sheath metabolomics analysis results show that BPH feeding induces distinct changes in the metabolite profiles of YHY15 and TN1 plants. These results suggest that BPH infestation enhance fatty acid oxidation, the glyoxylate cycle, gluconeogenesis and the GABA shunt in TN1 plants, and glycolysis and the shikimate pathway in YHY15. We propose that the BPH15 gene mediates a resistance reaction that increases the synthesis of secondary metabolites through the shikimate pathway. Thirty-three metabolites were identified in BPH honeydew. Honeydew metabolomics analysis results show that when BPH insects were fed on resistant YHY15 plants, most of the amino acids in honeydew were significantly decreased compared to those of BPH fed on TN1 plants. Based on metabolomics results, we propose that BPH feeding on resistant YHY15 plants would enhance amino acid absorption. At the same time, urea was significantly increased in BPH fed on YHY15. Conclusion Metabolomics study is valuable in understanding the complex and multifaceted interaction between plants and insect herbivores and provide essential clue for development of novel control BPH strategies.

Part one: cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE												Introduction: Macrocrystalline oxides of alkaline earth metals (Mg and Ca) or light metals (Al and Ti) can respond to standard warfare agents such as sulfur mustard, soman, or agent VX. In this paper, we compared the decontamination ability of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) for nitrogen mustards (cyclophosphamide [CP] and ifosfamide [IFOS]) with a new procedure using a destructive sorbent based on nanocrystalline and nanodispersive titanium dioxide (TiO2) as a new efficient and cheap material for complete decontamination of surfaces. Methods: Titanium (IV) dioxide nanoparticles were prepared by the homogeneous hydrolysis of titanium(IV) oxysulfate (TiOSO4) with urea. The as-prepared TiO2 nanoparticles were used for the fast and safe decontamination of cytostatics from the nitrogen mustard family (CP and IFOS) in water. The adsorption-degradation process of cytostatics in the presence of TiO2 was compared with decontamination agents (0.01 M solution of sodium hydroxide and 5% solution of sodium hypochlorite). The mechanism of the decontamination process and the degradation efficiency were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Results: It was demonstrated that a 0.01 M solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) decomposes CP to 3-((amino(bis(2-chloroethyl)amino)phosphoryl)oxy) propanoic acid and sodium hypochlorite formed two reaction products, namely, IFOS and 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide. IFOS is cytotoxic, and 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide is a known metabolite of CP after its partial metabolism by CYP/CYP450. IFOS degrades in the presence of NaOH to toxic IFOS mustard. Titanium(IV) dioxide nanoparticles adsorbed on its surface CP after 5 minutes and on IFOS after 10 minutes. The adsorption-degradation process of CP in water and in the presence of TiO2 led to 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide and IFOS, respectively, which decayed to oxidation product 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide. Conclusion: Nanodispersive TiO2 is an effective degradation agent for decontamination of surfaces from cytostatics in medical facilities.

Schiff's base derivatives of murrayanine demonstrated enhanced anti-oxidant activity than its parent moiety	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH												Objective: Free radicals like superoxide anion radical (O-2 center dot(-)), hydroxyl radical (HO center dot), alkyl radical (R-center dot), alkoxy radical (RO center dot), peroxy radical (ROO center dot) and nitric oxide radical (NO center dot) often leads to oncogenic proliferation, damage deoxyribosyl backbone of DNA, accelerate oxidation of polydesaturated fatty acids, amino acids, and several other co-factors. Several carbazole moieties present in M. koenigii L. like murrayanine, mahanimbine, curryanine, kurryam have been reported to exhibit good anti-oxidant activity. The present research represents an effort to develop few novel hybridized derivatives of murrayanine (an active carbazole derivative) by reacting with various small ligands like urea, semi carbazide and thio semi carbazide with an intention to develop Schiff's base compounds with higher and potent anti-oxidant activity than its parent moiety (murrayanine). Methods: The study protocol involved DPPH radical scavenging assay and determining in vitro reducing activity of the semi-synthetic derivatives. Results: The study revealed that compound 5 exhibited highest anti-oxidant activity (IC50 of 6.5 mu M), followed by derivative 3 which displayed activity at IC50 value of 7.3 mu M, which was superior as compared to murrayanine 1 which scavenge the radical at IC50 of 7.6 mu M. However, two semi-synthetic compounds (2 and 4) exhibited lesser activity compared to murrayanine, IC(50)s of 7.8 and 8.1 mu M, respectively. The compounds exhibited absorbance in range 0.76-1.3. Highest absorbance of 1.079 was demonstrated by 5. Conclusion: This study can be concluded that these derivatives may have enough potential to be used as antioxidants and open new doors for research perspectives towards the development of novel radical scavenging moiety.

In this study, an integrated echocardiography along with pathological examination and (1H) NMR analysis of multiple biological matrices (urine, serum, heart, and kidney) was employed to systemically assess the toxicity of DOX. Echocardiographic results showed that impaired left ventricular contractility and degenerative pathology lesions in DOX group, which were in consistent with pathology. The endogenous metabolites in the urine, serum, heart and kidney was identified by comparison with the data from the literature and databases. Multivariate analysis, including PCA and OPLS, revealed 8 metabolites in urine, including succinate, 2-ketoglutarate, citrate, hippurate, methylamine, benzoate, allantion, and acetate were the potential changed biomarkers. In serum, perturbed metabolites include elevation of leucine, beta-glucose, O-acetyl-glycoprotein, creatine, lysine, glycerin, dimethylglycine, trimethylamine-N-oxide, myo-inositol, and N-acetyl-glycoprotein, together with level decreases of acetone, lipid, lactate, glutamate, phosphocholine, acetoacetate and pyruvate. For heart, DOX exposure caused decline of lipid, lactate, leucine, alanine, glutamate, choline, xanthine, glycerin, carnitine, and fumarate, together with elevation of glutamine, creatine, inosine, taurine and malate. Metabolic changes of kidney were mainly involved in the accumulation of a-glucose, lactate, phosphocholine, betaine, threonine, choline, taurine, glycine, urea, hypoxanthine, glutamate, and nicotinamide, coupled with reduction of asparagine, valine, methionine, tyrosine, lysine, alanine, leucine, ornithine, creatine, lipid, and acetate. In addition, alterations of urinary metabolites exhibited a time-dependent manner. Complementary evidences by multiple matrices revealed disturbed pathways concerning energy metabolism, fatty acids oxidation, amino acids and purine metabolism, choline metabolism, and gut microbiota-related metabolism. In addition, the change of endogenous metabolites in rats urine, serum, heart and kidney were correlated with the echocardiography parameters. This integrative study should help to develop a systematic understanding of cardiomyopathy-related diseases and their metabolic events. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of nitrogen fertilisers on nitrous oxide emission, nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and bacterial diversity in closed ecological systems	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												In a 3-year microcosm study the nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from an agricultural soil amended with urea, ammonium sulphate or potassium nitrate were examined. Soil samples were taken every year to determine the soil physicochemical properties, the total abundance of bacteria, archaea, nitrifier and denitrifier communities and the changes in the structure and composition of the bacterial community. Gene abundance and biodiversity were estimated using quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing, respectively. The soils were watered weekly to reach 80% water filled pore space and varied from 80 to 62% during that time. N-fertilisation increased the abundance of bacteria and decreased that of archaea. Soils treated with ammonium or urea emitted more N2O than that amended with potassium nitrate and produced yearly increases in the abundance of nitrification genes. Also, the abundance of the denitrification genes gradually increased during the experimental period. N2O emission decreased on a yearly basis and so did the ratio of the genes involved in N2O production and reduction. A non-metric multidimensional scaling plot showed that N2O emission was positively related with the norB gene and negatively with the nosZ. The Shannon and Simpson diversity indices indicated that N-fertilisation reduced the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and that the bacterial community became dominated by a small group of OTUs, respectively. N-fertilisation reduced the number of OTUs whose relative abundance was lower than 1%. We conclude that potassium nitrate reduces N2O emissions and increases the abundance of the N2O reducers. This work also shows that N-fertilisation decreases soil biodiversity and that its response depends on the type of the N-fertiliser.

However, the metabolic types of different tumors are diverse and lack in-depth study. Here, through analysis of big databases and clinical samples, we identified a carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1)-deficient hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) subtype, explored tumorigenesis mechanism of this HCC subtype, and aimed to investigate metabolic reprogramming as a target for HCC prevention. Approach and Results A pan-cancer study involving differentially expressed metabolic genes of 7,764 tumor samples in 16 cancer types provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrated that urea cycle (UC) was liver-specific and was down-regulated in HCC. A large-scale gene expression data analysis including 2,596 HCC cases in 7 HCC cohorts from Database of HCC Expression Atlas and 17,444 HCC cases from in-house hepatectomy cohort identified a specific CPS1-deficent HCC subtype with poor clinical prognosis. In vitro and in vivo validation confirmed the crucial role of CPS1 in HCC. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay and Seahorse analysis revealed that UC disorder (UCD) led to the deceleration of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, whereas excess ammonia caused by CPS1 deficiency activated fatty acid oxidation (FAO) through phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase. Mechanistically, FAO provided sufficient ATP for cell proliferation and enhanced chemoresistance of HCC cells by activating forkhead box protein M1. Subcutaneous xenograft tumor models and patient-derived organoids were employed to identify that blocking FAO by etomoxir may provide therapeutic benefit to HCC patients with CPS1 deficiency. Conclusions In conclusion, our results prove a direct link between UCD and cancer stemness in HCC, define a CPS1-deficient HCC subtype through big-data mining, and provide insights for therapeutics for this type of HCC through targeting FAO.

Generally, B doping prior to N doping can improve N doping because the presence of oxidized B during N doping can interact with NH3, facilitating N doping. The performance of NB-BCs in PMS activation for ciprofloxacin (CIP) removal was evaluated and it was found that the kapp increased in the order of: N-BC (0.010 min-1) < B-BC (0.016 min-1) < NB-BC-2 (0.031 min-1) < NB-BC-3 (0.039 min-1) < NB-BC-1 (0.053 min-1). Due to its large specific surface area and synergistic interaction between N and B moieties, NB-BC-1 presented the best PMS activator, achieving CIP removal of-45 and-80 % by adsorption and degradation in 60 min, respectively. Further performance study using NB-BC-1 revealed that the kapp increased with increasing catalyst loading and PMS dosage. Meanwhile, higher pH can reduce the CIP removal efficiency due to the electrostatic repulsion between NB-BC-1 and PMS. It was also demonstrated that NB-BC-1 can be reused and regenerated after deactivation using thermal treatment at 500 degrees C. From the chemical scavengers and electrochemical studies, it can be deduced that NB-BC-1 activates PMS through both radical and nonradical pathways. Lastly, the degradation pathway of CIP was also proposed by identifying the degradation in-termediates and their toxicity were accessed. Overall, this study showed that NB-BC-1 can potentially be used as a PMS activator for wastewater treatment.

To change the electronic structure, chemical composition, and photocatalytic activity of CN, we report the deficient quinone ring monomer here. Thermal copolymerization of urea with 2,6-diaminoantandantquinone (DQ) monomer is an efficient synthesis of a sequence of modified CN photocatalysts. Results show that the optical absorption capacity is improved by modulating the quinone ring in the CN framework, improving its charge transfer and separation of photogenerated electron and holes. The modified CN shows a notable improvement in the photocatalytic activity of overall water splitting, such as hydrogen evolution rate (HER) and oxygen evolution rate (OER). The co-polymerized CN-DQ(5.0) displays a remarkable activity of 520.8 mu mol/h of H-2 evolution and 6.8 mu mol/h of O-2 evolution, which is around 8 times and 4.5 times greater than CN. The universal copolymerization by a small, optimized amount of monomer DQ explores a remarkable improvement in the photocatalytic activity. Novelty Statement We manifested the process of molecular doping with carbon nitride (CN) semiconductor for utilization of solar heat radiation into chemical energy under sunlight perspective. Here, we suggest a novel nanoscopic organic-conjugated heterocyclic monomer 2,6-diaminoantandantquinone (DQ) monomer as a demonstrator within CN that boost the photocatalytic properties. An identifiable undulation occurred in the surface area, electronic structure, calculated band gap, and chemical composition analysis of CN and also improved its electronic generation process under visible light radiance. The superior photocatalyst stimulated a tremendous photocatalytic activity of water reduction and water oxidation as enhanced catalytic performances compared of pristine sample, respectively.

J	Wani, MR; Maheshwari, N; Shadab, G				Wani, Mohammad Rafiq; Maheshwari, Nikhil; Shadab, Ghulam			Eugenol attenuates TiO2 nanoparticles-induced oxidative damage, biochemical toxicity and DNA damage in Wistar rats: an in vivo study	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) are widely used in food, edible dyes, and other commercial products. Human exposure to TiO2 NPs has raised concerns regarding their toxic potential. Various studies have evaluated the TiO2 NPs-induced toxicity, oxidative damage to the cellular components, and genotoxicity. In the present study, we examined whether co-treatment with the dietary antioxidant eugenol can attenuate or protect against TiO2 NPs-induced toxicity. We exposed the adult male Wistar rats to TiO2 NPs (150 mg/kg body weight) by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) either alone or as co-treatment with eugenol (1-10 mg/kg body weight) once a day for 14 days. The untreated rats were supplied saline and served as control. Titanium (Ti) accumulation in various tissues was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Serum levels of liver and kidney biomarkers and oxidative stress markers in the liver, kidney, and spleen were determined. A significant increase in hydrogen peroxide level confirmed that oxidative stress occurred in these tissues. TiO2 NPs induced oxidation of lipids, and decreased glutathione level and antioxidant enzyme activity in the kidney, liver, and spleen of treated rats. TiO2 NPs also increased the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, and total cholesterol and decreased the blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, and total bilirubin in serum, which indicates oxidative damage to the liver and kidney. In eugenol and TiO2 NPs co-treated rats, all these changes were mitigated. Single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) of lymphocytes showed longer comet tail length in TiO2 NPs-treated groups, indicating DNA damage while tail length was reduced in eugenol and TiO2 NPs co-treated groups.

Erythrocytes' Reactions to Osmotic, Ammonium, and Oxidative Stress are Inhibited Under Hypoxic Conditions	BIOLOGICHESKIE MEMBRANY												Hypoxic conditions, in addition to effects on the CO2 and O-2 transport, may have an impact on various functions of red blood cells (RBCs) including ion and metabolic regulation, oxidative stress induction, and transport of nitrites, ammonia, urea, etc. We used laser diffraction, spectrometry, and flow cytometry for evaluation of the responses of lower vertebrates' and human RBCs to hypoosmotic conditions, ammonia and oxidative stress in normoxia and hypoxia. Under hypoosmotic conditions RBCs of lower vertebrates swell and immediately initiate the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) reaction. In our experiments, the RVD reaction in RBCs of Carassius carassius and Rana temporaria was inhibited in hypoxic conditions and restored by reoxygenation. Transport of ammonia/ammonium in human RBCs is facilitated via functional interaction of ammonium (RhAG) and anion (AE1) transporters. Ammonium transport in human RBCs was inhibited in hypoxic conditions, whereas the switch of hemoglobin from R- to T- state in hypoxia restored the rate of ammonia/ammonium transport. Oxidative stress inhibits esterase activity, triggers hemoglobin oxidation to fermi-forms, Fe(III), Fe(IV), phosphatidylserine externalization, AE1 clusterization, and microparticle formation. In the conditions of oxidative stress, hypoxia prevents cell death via apoptosis by inhibiting phosphatidylserine externalization, AE1 clusterization, and microparticles formation. The obtained results indicate that hemoglobin conformation plays a significant role in the process of volume regulation not only in higher but in lower vertebrates as well. In human RBCs transport of CO2 (HCO3-) and NH3 (NH4+) is dependent on the AE1 activity, which is regulated by hemoglobin conformational changes. Hypoxic conditions prevent apoptosis of RBCs by preserving them from oxidative stress. Thus, our data clearly show that hypoxic conditions have beneficial effects on the RBC long-term storage.

The aim of the present work was to study the metabolic trajectories at the postprandial (PP) state in a relevant human nutrition animal model combining plasma metabolome analysis with classical metabolism exploration tools. In a first trial, three mini pigs were fed a test meal and arterial blood samples withdrawn before and over 4 h following the meal for plasma metabolites analysis (LC-MS and classical biochemistry). In a second trial, three mini-pigs were euthanized after an overnight fasting and three others 1:15 h after the test meal. The metabolism was explored at the molecular (mRNA levels), biochemical (enzyme activities) and signalling (phosphorylation status) levels in the liver and muscle. As expected, and in accordance with alterations in plasma glucose, urea levels, gluconeogenesis/glycolysis/lipid and amino acid (AA) oxidation genes expression and enzymes activities, the metabolomic approach discriminated the PA from the PP state (R(2)Ycum = 0.991; Q(2)Ycum = 0.921). More interestingly hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that the PP metabolome included actually four types of kinetic profiles. Further, PLS-DA analysis revealed a two-step pattern: 1-2 and 3-4 h (R(2)Ycum = 0.837; Q(2)cum = 0.635). Among the molecules explaining this discrimination, several AAs and phospholipid species were highlighted and their significance in PP metabolism discussed. Our data showed that the combination of these approaches in mini-pigs could be used to investigate PP metabolic adaptations in various physiological and patho-physiological states.

One-step preparation of silver electrodeposits from non-aqueous solvents	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS												http://172.20.145.48/elsevier_cbt/wp-login.php?loggedout=trueThis paper describes the Ag electrodeposition on platinum electrode in different deep eutectic solvents (DES) as electrolytes, such as choline chloride:ethylene glycol (ChCl:EG) and choline chloride:urea (ChCl:U), using a molar ratio of 1:2. Having a concentration of 0.05 mol L-1 of silver nitrate in each DES, the electrodeposition was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), which shown a sole reduction and oxidation processes. The electrodeposition temperature was also studied in both solvents, having the Ag+ ions reduction peak potential shifted to relative lesser negative values and the reduction peak current relatively increased if compared with room temperature (RT) voltammograms. Using the optimized voltammetric conditions of Ag electrodeposition, the cathodic yield reached >80% in all studied temperatures and DES solutions. Chronoamperometric experiments were conducted in order to achieve Cottrell plots for determination of Ag+ ions diffusion coefficient (D-o) for all DES electrolytes and temperatures, and its magnitude order was around 10(-7) cm s(-1) due to viscosity of the DES. In order to study the Ag nucleation mechanism in both DES electrolytes, dimensionless Scharifker-Hills (S-H) model was applied, The analysis showed that Ag electrocrystallization in ChCl:EG had an intermediate mechanism at 25 degrees C and 45 degrees C, while 70 degrees C presented an instantaneous behavior, and Ag electrodeposition in ChCl:U showed progressive electrocrystallization in 25 degrees C and instantaneous behavior at 45 degrees C and 70 degrees C. SEM images showed a distribution of sub-micrometer Ag particles over bulk Ag electrodeposit, suggesting that Ag+ ions deposition using ChCl:EG and ChCl:U DES as electrolytes can achieve electrochemical synthesis of Ag microparticles.

It is necessary to test a synergistic interaction between apoA-I and CIGB-258 in reconstituted high-density lipoproteins (rHDL). Several rHDLs were synthesized containing palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), cholesterol, apoA-I, and CIGB-258 at molar ratios of 95:5:1:0, 95:5:1:0.1, 95:5:1:0.5, and 95:5:1:1 for rHDL-(1:0), rHDL-(1:0.1), rHDL-(1:0.5), and rHDL-(1:1), respectively. As the CIGB-258 content in rHDL was increased, the particle size of rHDL was 1.4-times higher than rHDL-(1:0) to rHDL-(1:1), from 60 nm to 83 nm, respectively. As the CIGB-258 content was increased, the rHDL showed the most resistance to isothermal denaturation by a urea treatment, and rHDL-(1:1) exhibited the highest structural stability and the strongest antioxidant ability against LDL oxidation. Co-treatment of rHDL-(1:0), rHDL-(1:0.5), and rHDL-(1:1) resulted in up to 10%, 24%, and 34% inhibition of HDL glycation, inhibition of HDL glycation, which was caused by the CML, with protection of apoA-I. Microinjection of each rHDL into zebrafish embryos in the presence of CML showed that a higher CIGB-258 content in rHDL was associated with higher survivability with the least inflammation and apoptosis. Furthermore, an intraperitoneal injection of rHDL and CML showed that a higher CIGB-258 content in rHDL was also associated with higher survivability of zebrafish and faster recovery of swimming ability. The rHDL-(1:1) group showed the lowest triglyceride, AST, and ALT serum levels with the least production of interleukin-6, oxidized product, and neutrophil infiltration in hepatic tissue. In conclusion, CIGB-258 could bind well to phospholipids and cholesterol to stabilize apoA-I in the rHDL structure against denaturation stress and larger particle sizes. The rHDL containing CIGB-258 enhanced the in vitro antioxidant ability against LDL oxidation, the anti-glycation activity to protect HDL, and the in vivo anti-inflammatory activity against CML toxicity in zebrafish adults and embryos. Overall, incorporating apoA-I and CIGB-258 in rHDL resulted in a synergistic interaction to enhance the structural and functional correlations in a dose-dependent manner of CIGB-258.						cho, Kyung-Hyun/0000-0003-1198-4140														1424-8247				FEB	2024	17	2							165	10.3390/ph17020165	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ph17020165								38399381					WOS:001172287000001

Modified with ammonium nitrate, H-USY could largely improve the conversion in the alkylation reaction of benzene with cyclohexene due to the increase in Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area, Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore volume, BJH pore size, and acidity of H-USY. Catalyzed by the molecular sieve modified twice with ammonium nitrate, this alkylation reaction demonstrated a 95.3 % conversion of cyclohexene with 97.4 % selectivity of cyclohexylbenzene. And we found that urea-modified USY has the similar effect, a 96.1 % conversion of cyclohexene with slightly 94.9 % selectivity of cyclohexylbenzene.

Electrolysis is considered a promising method to degrade these nitrogenous pollutants in sewage, with the advantages of high efficiency, wide generality, easy operability, retrievability, and environmental friendliness. For particular energy devices, including metal-nitrate batteries, direct fuel cells, and hybrid water electrolyzers, the realization of energy valorization from sewage purification processes (e.g., valuable chemical generation, electricity output, and hydrogen production) becomes feasible. Despite the progress in the research on pollutant electrodegradation, the development of electrocatalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity for pollutant removal, coupled with corresponding energy devices, remains a challenge. This review comprehensively provides advanced insights into the electrodegradation processes of nitrogenous pollutants and relevant energy valorization strategies, focusing on the reaction mechanisms, activity descriptors, electrocatalyst design, and actuated electrodes and operation parameters of tailored energy conversion devices. A feasibility analysis of electrodegradation on real wastewater samples from the perspective of pollutant concentration, pollutant accumulation, and electrolyte effects is provided. Challenges and prospects for the future development of electrodegradation systems are also discussed in detail to bridge the gap between experimental trials and commercial applications.

The elimination of herbicides followed pseudo first-order kinetics well. Then effects of UV intensity, pH, PS dosage and water matrix (background ions and Nature organic matter (NOM)) were investigated detailedly. Increased k(obs) values were observed at higher PS dosages and greater UV intensity, but the degradation was basically resistant to pH variation. k(obs) could be inhibited by coexistent ions and NOM. Radical scavenging study revealed the more important role of sulfate radical (SR, SO4 center dot-) than hydroxyl radical (HR, HO center dot). k(app) of HO center dot and SO4 center dot- towards isoproturon and chlortoluron were determined respectively. The results also indicated that the relative reactivity of alkyl-or halogen-substituted phenylurea herbicides with HO center dot and SO4 center dot- can be correlated with Hammett constants as the molecular descriptor. Then a quantitative structure-activity relationship was established to predict the structure-dependent reactivity of phenylurea herbicides by UV/PS concerning substituent effects. The energy demand of UV/PS system was evaluated. The degradation intermediates by direct UV, UV/H2O2 as well as UV/PS were comparatively identified and the related destruction pathways were postulated. Compared with UV and UV/H2O2, UV/PS was superior in controlling the DBPs generation in post-disinfection of these herbicides. The data supported that SR-advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) had more advantages in removal efficiency and toxicity control than HR-AOPs. This study provided some theoretical bases for the UV/PS degradation behaviors of structurally similar phenylurea herbicides with regard to different substituents on the aromatic ring.

However, the impact of specific nitrogen moieties in nitrogen-doped carbon dots on Au-H formation and catalytic activity remains unexplored. These nitrogen species, acting as surface ligands, may influence the catalytic properties through the generation of Au-H species via H-center dot radicals. In this regard, modulation of the catalytic properties of Au nanoparticles has been explored by conjugating their surface with nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCDs). Three distinct nanohybrid formulations comprising NCDs and Au nanoparticles (i.e., NCDs-Au) have been prepared, where the NCDs were derived from different carbon sources (e.g., citric acid and l-malic acid) and varying mole ratios of the nitrogen source (i.e., urea). The impact of NCDs on Au nanoparticle-mediated catalysis has been investigated using the model reaction of hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in the presence of NaBH4. The fractions of different nitrogen species (such as pyrrolic, pyridinic, and amidic) in the different NCDs-Au nanohybrids were quantified through XPS analysis, and their roles in catalytic performance have been studied. Further, the size, shape, crystallinity, defects, and exposed facets of the NCDs-Au nanohybrids have also been assessed (through XRD, HRTEM, and Raman studies), and their structure-activity relationships have been corroborated. The hydrogenation of 4-NP is proposed to happen through the formation of gold-hydride (Au-H) species facilitated by H-center dot radicals, as confirmed by EPR analysis. The NCDs-Au nanohybrid, synthesized from NCDs derived from a 1:3 molar ratio of l-malic acid and urea (MU13-Au), exhibits superior catalytic efficiency with a rate constant of 1.013 min(-1), attributed to its abundant defects and a notably high relative content of catalytically favorable pyridinic nitrogen species compared to other tested nanohybrids.

In addition to the more conventional photocatalysts (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, etc.) that utilize only UV light for activation, the interest of the scientific community has recently focused on the development and application of visible light-activated photocatalysts like g-C3N4. However, some disadvantages of g-C3N4, such as the high recombination rate of photogenerated charges, limit its utility. In this light, the present study focuses on the synthesis of WO3 fibers/g-C3N4 Z-scheme heterojunctions to improve the efficiency of g-C3N4 towards the photocatalytic removal of the widely used insecticide clothianidin. The effect of two different g-C3N4 precursors (urea and thiourea) and of WO3 fiber content on the properties of the synthesized composite materials was also investigated. All aforementioned materials were characterized by a number of techniques (XRD, SEM-EDS, ATR-FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, DRS, etc.). According to the results, mixing 6.5% (W)/(W) WO3 fibers with either urea or thiourea derived g-C3N4 significantly increased the photocatalytic activity of the resulting composites compared to the precursor materials. In order to further elucidate the effect of the most efficient composite photocatalyst in the degradation of clothianidin, the generated transformation products were tentatively identified through UHPLC tandem high-resolution mass spectroscopy. Finally, the detoxification effect of the most efficient process was also assessed by combining the results of an in-vitro methodology and the predictions of two in-silico tools.

Gold nanospikes (AuNS), as one of the gold nanoparticle morphologies, can be integrated into biosensors through electrodeposition and has the potential to immobilize bioreceptor on biosensors using the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) method. This paper examines the potential of AuNS-deposited Screen-Printed Carbon Electrodes (SPCEs) on immobilizing enzymes as label-based electrochemical biosensor by evaluating the optimum parameter for glucose oxidase (GOx) enzyme immobilization on the SPCE that consists of incubation time and concentration of SAM molecule-L-cysteine-and GOx enzyme, then reviews its performances. The developed biosensor exhibits excellent performance in detecting glucose (linear range of 0.2-15 mM and limit of detection (LOD) of 116 mu M), with good selectivity against uric acid, urea, ascorbic acid, dopamine, and lactic acid, and superiority towards gold nanosphere modified biosensor.

The flow intensity of the pumped air is controlled by the pore structure of nanofilbrillated cellulose, urea-modified chitosan, or polymethylsilsesquioxane (PMSQ) aerogels. The MnO2-induced photothermal conversion drives both the passive gas flow and the catalytic degradation of volatile organic pollutants. All investigated aerogels demonstrate superior pumping compared to benchmarked Knudsen pump systems, but the inorganic PMSQ aerogels provide the highest flexibility in terms of the input power and photothermal degradation activity. Aerogel light-driven multifunctional gas pumps offer a broad future application potential for gas-sensing devices, air-quality mapping, and air quality control systems.

From XRD and XPS analysis, nitrogen has been successfully incorporated into ZnO lattices without introducing other N-containing or Zn-containing phases. Such nitrogen doping can enhance the visible light harvesting ability and inhibit the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs; as a result, improved visible light driven photocatalytic activity was achieved in N-doped porous ZnO and the photocatalytic activity of N-doped ZnO is 2.58 times higher than that of ZIF-derived pure ZnO.

CenO2n+1N+ species appeared as products of the reaction CenO2n+ + NO -> CenO2n+1N+, and their collision cross sections (CCSs) with helium were obtained by IMMS. The experimental CCSs of CenO2n+1N+ were 2-6 angstrom(2) larger than those of CenO2n+ for n = 4-10. Geometrical structures of Ce4O9N+ and Ce5O11N+ were assigned by comparing experimental CCSs with theoretically calculated CCSs of candidate structures. The suggested structures showed that the adsorbed NO molecule is oxidized by the CenO2n+ cluster into a nitrite (NO2-) or nitrate (NO3-). The CenO2n+1N+ species are regarded as intermediates of the NO oxidation reaction CenO2n+ + NO -> CenO2n-1+ + NO2, and therefore, the present results are helpful for understanding redox reactions involving gas-phase CenO2n+ cluster ions.					; Misaizu, Fuminori/E-8607-2015	Ohshimo, Keijiro/0000-0002-2397-6896; Misaizu, Fuminori/0000-0003-0822-6285; Nagata, Toshiaki/0000-0002-7127-1487													1089-5639	1520-5215				FEB 24	2022	126	7					1204	1210		10.1021/acs.jpca.1c10835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.1c10835								35167295					WOS:000765159100018

The doping of Sm significantly altered the activity of N2O decomposition on the Co3O4 catalyst. Sm was incorporated into the Co3O4 matrix, leading to the distortion of Co3O4 lattice with the spinel configuration maintained. Sm-doping can effectively promote the oxygen vacancy generation, and the electron interaction between Co and Sm species occurred as the Co3+ + Sm2+ ? Co2+ + Sm3+ redox cycle. Combined with in situ Raman and in situ NAP-XPS results proposed that this redox cycle is the main reason that the Sm-doping accelerates the high-efficiency N2O decomposition.

Various ZrO2-based catalysts, having different compositions of monoclinic and tetragonal crystal phases, are successfully prepared in the presence of a baseviaa solvothermal process. From the detailed characterization through XRD, TEM, CO2-TPD, XPS, AES, BET and poisoning studies, M-ZrO2-U-N, synthesized using zirconium oxynitrate and urea as a precursor and precipitant, respectively, in water, possesses a 100% monoclinic crystal phase with a maximum amount of exposed (-111) facets and surface oxygen concentration along with the highest number of basic sites. The catalytic study on the transformation of furfural (FFA) into furfuryl alcohol (FOH) reveals that M-ZrO2-U-N exhibits the best efficiency with a nearly quantitative yield of FOH. On the other hand, T-ZrO2-U-N, synthesized using zirconium oxynitrate and urea as a precursor and precipitant, respectively, in methanol, is found to have a 94.4% tetragonal phase and a 2.2-fold lower number of basic sites in comparison with M-ZrO2-U-N. The catalytic result with T-ZrO2-U-N displays the lowest activity in terms of the FOH yield (8.1%). According to the comparative and systematic catalytic studies with the various ZrO(2)catalysts having different amounts of tetragonal and monoclinic phases, the ZrO(2)catalyst having a more monoclinic phase with more exposed (-111) facets, basic sites, surface oxygen species and surface area is found to be crucial for the FFA conversion to FOH with high selectivity. M-ZrO2-U-N is found to be stable and recyclable and also shows excellent activity towards the transformation of other bio-aldehydes and ketones into their corresponding alcohols.

Nitrosopumilus maritimus gen. nov., sp nov., Nitrosopumilus cobalaminigenes sp nov., Nitrosopumilus oxyclinae sp nov., and Nitrosopumilus ureiphilus sp nov., four marine ammonia-oxidizing archaea of the phylum Thaumarchaeota	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY												Four mesophilic, neutrophilic, and aerobic marine ammonia-oxidizing archaea, designated strains SCM1(T), HCA1(T), HCE1(T) and PS0(T), were isolated from a tropical marine fish tank, dimly lit deep coastal waters, the lower euphotic zone of coastal waters, and near-surface sediment in the Puget Sound estuary, respectively. Cells are straight or slightly curved small rods, 0.15-0.26 mu m in diameter and 0.50-1.59 mu m in length. Motility was not observed, although strain PS0(T) possesses genes associated with archaeal flagella and chemotaxis, suggesting it may be motile under some conditions. Cell membranes consist of glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids, with crenarchaeol as the major component. Strain SCM1(T) displays a single surface layer (S-layer) with p6 symmetry, distinct from the p3-S-layer reported for the soil ammonia-oxidizing archaeon Nitrososphaera viennensis EN76(T). Respiratory quinones consist of fully saturated and monounsaturated menaquinones with 6 isoprenoid units in the side chain. Cells obtain energy from ammonia oxidation and use carbon dioxide as carbon source; addition of an a-keto acid (a-ketoglutaric acid) was necessary to sustain growth of strains HCA1(T), HCE1(T), and PS0(T). Strain PS0(T) uses urea as a source of ammonia for energy production and growth. All strains synthesize vitamin B-1 (thiamine), B-2 (riboflavin), B-6 (pyridoxine), and B-12 (cobalamin). Optimal growth occurs between 25 and 32 degrees C, between pH 6.8 and 7.3, and between 25 and 37% salinity. All strains have a low mol% G+C content of 33.0-34.2. Strains are related by 98% or greater 16S rRNA gene sequence identity, sharing similar to 85% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with Nitrososphaera viennensis EN76(T). All four isolates are well separated by phenotypic and genotypic characteristics and are here assigned to distinct species within the genus Nitrosopumilus gen. nov.

In this research, the partial oxidization of sucrose with sodium periodate generated multiple aldehydes, which acted as multifunctional cross-linkers and endowed cotton fabrics with anti-crease and hydrophilic function. The results showed that the oxysucrose-treated cotton fabrics obtained the maximum crease recovery angle of 245 degrees, durable press rating of 3.0, and whiteness index of 82.8. Importantly, the oxysucrose-treated samples showed better hydrophilicity that overcomes the hydrophobization deficiency of anti-creased cotton fabrics treated with previously reported dimethylol dihydroxy ethylene urea (DMDHEU), glutaraldehyde (GA), and 1, 2, 3, 4,-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA).

The photocatalysts were prepared via chemical co-precipitation using thermal urea hydrolysis, without calcination or activation processes, and were applied in the photodegradation of micropollutants (in this case, several phenolic compounds). Characterization of the materials using various techniques revealed that the generation of hydroxyl radicals, holes, and superoxide radicals played crucial roles in the photodegradation process. The best photocatalyst was achieved with a 10 mol% SnO2 content in hydrozincite, which shows the highest rate in the pollutants degradation (higher than 93% in all the cases), also higher than TiO2-P25This study presents promising insights for developing highly efficient photocatalytic materials for environmental remediation applications.

Influences of dietary supplementation of peanut skin powder (Arachis Hypogaea) on growth performance, carcass traits, blood chemistry, antioxidant activity and meat quality of broilers	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE												The present study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with powdered peanut skin (PS) as natural antioxidant and growth promoter on growth performance, carcass characteristics, serum metabolites and meat quality of Cobb broiler chickens. A total of 240 unsexed Cobb 500 1-week-old broiler chicks were randomly assigned to four treatment groups with six replicates. The dietary treatments consisted of the basal diet as control and PS groups (1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 PS g/kg). Results showed that the highest values (P < 0.01) of live bodyweight and bodyweight gain were observed in the control group at 3 weeks of age and during the period of 1-3 weeks of age, respectively compared with all levels of PS. During 1-3 weeks of age, feed intake per day chicks fed the diet containing PS levels decreased numerically (P> 0.01) with increased levels of PS compared with the control. Supplementing 1.0 or 3.0 g/kg of PS insignificantly enhanced feed conversion ratio at 1-6 weeks of age. Dietary treatments significantly depressed giblets (P = 0.002), thigh (P = 0.0.027) and abdominal fat percentages (P> 0.0.1), however, increased (P= 0.004) breast percentage of broiler chicks at 6 weeks of age. The lowest value of serum creatinine and urea achieved by chicks fed diet contained 3.0 PS g/kg diet. Also, high density lipoprotein cholesterol in addition to triglycerides were significantly (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) decreased with increasing level of PS supplementation. It can be concluded that PS as a phytogenic additive could be used as a supplementation to broiler diets to lower abdominal fat in carcass and cholesterol, creatinin and urea in blood. Sensory characteristics were not affected except that appearance was improved. Water-holding capacity was also improved.

Although recent advancements in recycling technology have facilitated the direct conversion of polyolefins to hydrocarbons or oxygenated compounds, the synthesis of nitrogenated compounds from such waste polyolefins has not yet been disclosed. Herein, we demonstrate a novel approach for the upcycling of waste polyolefins by efficiently transforming a range of postconsumer plastic products into nitriles and amides. This process leverages the catalytic properties of manganese dioxide in combination with an inexpensive nitrogen source, urea, to make it both practical and economically viable. Our approach not only opens new avenues for the creation of nitrogenated chemicals from polyolefin waste but also underscores the critical importance of recycling and valorizing carbon resources originally derived from fossil fuels. This study provides a new upcycling strategy for the sustainable conversion of waste polyolefins.

Preparation of dibenzoylhydrazine carboxamide (C) was performed by the treatment of 5,6-diaryl-3-methylthio-1,2,4-triazine (B) with Oxone which leads to oxidation and triazine ring cleavage in high yield (82%). Five benzylamine derivatives containing different electron donating and withdrawing substituents were used in this study. Yields for the conversion of dibenzoylhydrazine carboxamide (C) to N-acylureas (E1-5) were in the range of 40-55%. The structures of the intermediates and final products were characterized and confirmed by NMR, mass spectrometry and single-crystal X-ray crystallography.

The obtained materials were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, Raman, XPS, TG-DTA and N-2 adsorption/desorption at 77 K. The results showed that the composites consisted of W18O49 as a main phase which was coated by a thin carbon layer and exhibited a change in shape with heating temperature. The hollow form appeared from the treatment temperature of 700 degrees C and remained till 900 degrees C. However, at treatment 900 degrees C, the W18O49 disappeared and WO2 formed instead.

Here, three dimensional nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) nanosheet arrays are in-situ fabricated on self-supporting nitrogen doped graphited foam (NGF) via a one-step hydrothermal process under an optimized amount of urea. The as prepared NiFe LDH/NGF electrode exhibits a remarkable activity toward OER with a low onset overpotential of 233 mV and a Tafel slope of 59.4 mV dec(-1) as well as a long-term durability.

Copolymers containing isocyanate groups were synthesized by a radical copolymerization of 2-propenyl isocyanate (2PI) and styrene (St). The stability of the obtained copolymers on water was examined to find that isocyanate groups were protected by the hydrophobic polystyrene segment and were stable on water and these isocyanates reacted with primary amines including amino acids to form urea selectively on water. Primary amines with a higher octanol-water partition coefficient or smaller steric hindrance were more reactive to the isocyanate groups in the side chain of the copolymer. The protection of reactive isocyanate groups using the hydrophobic styrene segment did not give side products which are produced in the usual chemical protection/deprotection process.

A welfare assessment at the herd level and a retrospective subclinical diseases screening were used as blocking factors for the selection of reference individuals. Thus, this study provides measurements of the physiological variations affecting plasma analytes concentrations during the pivotal stages of the lactation cycle in a healthy, high welfare-raised subset of reference individuals and suggest an explanation for the underlying processes involved. Finally, we propose reference intervals for plasma analytes in the stages investigated. Here, we tested the changes occurring in several plasma analytes during different stages of the lactation cycle of high welfare raised multiparous Holstein cows, and provided reference intervals (RI) for plasma analytes concentrations. Eleven high-welfare farms (HWF) located in Northern Italy were selected and their herds used to recruit 361 clinically healthy cows undergoing the dry (from -30 to -10 days from real calving; DFC), the postpartum (from 3 to 7 DFC), the early lactation (from 28 to 45 DFC) and the late lactation phases (from 160 to 305 DFC). Cows affected by subclinical diseases (SCD) were retrospectively excluded, and a subset of 285 cows was selected. Data of plasma analytes underwent ANOVA testing using physiological phases as predictors. The individual effect of each phase was assessed using a pairwise t-test assuming p <= 0.05 as a significance limit. A bootstrap approach was used to define the reference interval (RI) for each blood analyte within physiological phases having a pairwise t-test p <= 0.05. The concentration of nonesterified fatty acids, albumin, cholesterol, retinol, paraoxonase and tocopherol changed throughout all the physiological phases, whereas the concentration of K, alkaline phosphatase and thiol groups remained stable. Triglycerides, Zn, and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power in the dry phase and BHB, Ca, myeloperoxidase, haptoglobin, reactive oxygen metabolites and advanced oxidation of protein product in postpartum differed compared with other physiological phases. During the dry phase, Packed cell volume, Cl, and urea concentrations were similar to during the postpartum phase. Similarly, Na, gamma-glutamyl transferase and beta-carotene concentrations were similar to during the early lactation phase; fructosamine and bilirubin concentrations were similar to during the late lactation phase. During the postpartum phase, fructosamine and P concentrations were similar to during the early lactation phase, and the aspartate transaminase concentration was similar to during the late lactation phase. During the early lactation phase, Mg, creatinine, total protein, globulin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were similar to during the postpartum phase, while the urea concentration was similar to during the late lactation phase. All these plasma analytes differed among the other phases. This study identifies physiological trends affecting plasma analytes concentrations during the different stages of the lactation cycle and provides a guideline for the duration and magnitude of their changes when animals are healthy and raised in optimal welfare conditions.

J	Lee, J; Theis, JR; Kyriakidou, EA				Lee, Jungkuk; Theis, Joseph R.; Kyriakidou, Eleni A.			Vehicle emissions trapping materials: Successes, challenges, and the path forward	APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL												The modern three-way catalyst (TWC) is very effective for treating the hydrocarbons (HCs), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from stoichiometric gasoline engines once the TWC has achieved its minimum operating temperature (e.g., 250 to 400 degrees C, depending on the gas species). Likewise, the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst with urea injection, and the diesel particulate filter (DPF) are effective for treating the HCs, CO, NOx, and particulate matter (PM) emissions from diesel engines once the catalysts are warmed up, although this can require a significant length of time (e.g., 1 to 3 min) because of the relatively low exhaust temperatures from diesel engines. For both types of engines, excess fueling is often used to accelerate the heating of the catalyst system after a cold start, although this decreases the fuel economy of the vehicle. Even with excess fueling, a high portion (up to 80%) of the total vehicle emissions is emitted during the cold start period (i.e., the period before the catalysts are functional). To treat the HC emissions during this cold start period, one approach is to employ a HC trap (HCT) that can adsorb the HC emissions at low temperatures and then oxidize the stored HCs to carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) at higher temperatures. To treat the NOx emissions during the cold start period, a passive NOx adsorber (PNA) can adsorb the NOx at low temperatures. For stoichiometric gasoline applications, the PNA can then reduce the stored NOx to nitrogen (N-2) at higher temperatures. On diesel engines, the PNA can release the stored NOx back into the exhaust once the downstream urea/SCR system is operational. Some adsorber technologies have the capability of adsorbing HCs and NOx simultaneously. In this review, the HC trapping and passive NOx adsorbing technologies will be discussed in separate sections. This review will describe how the current trapping technologies can be applied in vehicle exhaust systems, the material properties required for efficient HCTs and PNAs, and the exhaust conditions that can inhibit/enhance their trapping properties. First, the performance of HCTs will be discussed in terms of their physical properties (e.g., pore size, acidity, presence of metal ions) and the trapping conditions (e.g., storage temperature, space velocity, and the presence of other exhaust species such as H2O and CO2). This will be followed by in-depth coverage of the reactions occurring during HC desorption. The second part of this review will focus on the composition of various PNA formulations, the effects of the trapping conditions (e.g., temperature, space velocity, the presence of other exhaust species such as CO2, H2O, CO, and C2H4), and the effects of sulfur poisoning on their trapping performance. The effect of hydrothermal aging and the regenerability of HCTs and PNAs will also be discussed. A significant amount of literature has emerged recently regarding HCTs and PNAs; this review is primarily focused on summarizing this literature and reconciling the differences presented.

In this work, a well-known long alkyl aminoamide gelator was added to a metal salt solution in DES to obtain a more viscous solution or a more robust gel when introduced at the higher concentrations. These supramolecular gels could be employed as template for the generation of small noble metal nanoparticles of narrow distribution such as AuNPs or CoNPs without need of seed or reducing agent addition, immobilized in the gel matrix and also homogeneous in shape and size. All gel samples were studied by FE-SEM observation, XRD, FT-IR spectroscopy, rheology measurement and DSC.

J	Beltrán, FJ; Rey, A				Beltran, F. J.; Rey, A.			Free Radical and Direct Ozone Reaction Competition to Remove Priority and Pharmaceutical Water Contaminants with Single and Hydrogen Peroxide Ozonation Systems	OZONE-SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												From the application of concepts derived from the gas-liquid absorption film model, the competition between ozone reactions with 72 water emerging or priority contaminants (pharmaceuticals, pesticides, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, etc.) and the initiation steps of the hydroxyl radical decomposition of ozone in ozone alone and combined with hydrogen peroxide oxidation systems has been studied. With this information, the ozone preferential reaction, that is, the ozone direct reaction or the formation of free radicals and the kinetic absorption regime are known. In a second step, the ratio of removal rates of the contaminants studied by reacting with hydroxyl radical and ozone has also been estimated. With this, the way contaminants are preferentially removed (from their reaction with ozone or from the reaction with free radicals) can also be known and, hence, whether or not an ozone advanced oxidation system is convenient to be applied. For instance, most of the contaminants studied in this work at concentrations lower than 50gL(-1) and hydrogen peroxide at concentrations lower than 50mgL(-1) react with ozone under chemical control regime so that both direct and free radical reactions theoretically compete. However, under chemical control, typical concentration of scavengers present in wastewater or surface water would inhibit the free radical reactions and, at least theoretically, for many contaminants studied here, the direct ozone reaction is the principal removal way. When mass transfer controls the process rate only contaminants with a hydroxyl and ozone rate constant ratio 1.6x10(6) M(-1)s(-1) would be preferentially removed through free radical way.

In particular, in soils with strong nitrification potential, biochar addition may increase N2O emissions. Thus, in soils with strong nitrification potential, the combination of biochar with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) may be more effective in reducing N2O emissions than biochar alone. However, the combined use of biochar and DMPP on soil N2O emissions is relatively unexplored, and underlying microbial mechanisms of how biochar and/or DMPP amendment affect N2O emissions is still largely unknown. Here, a 30-day incubation experiment was established with four treatments: CK (control), BC (biochar), DMPP, and BD (biochar and DMPP), all at agronomically recommended rates, and N cycling assessed following addition of urea. Treatment of soil with BC, DMPP and BD reduced N2O emissions (compared with urea alone) by 59.1%, 95.5% and 74.1%, respectively. Quantification of N cycling genes (amoA, nirS, nirK, and nosZ) indicated that biochar stimulated growth of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), while DMPP alone inhibited the activity and growth of AOB. In the BD treatment, DMPP was absorbed onto biochar reducing its efficacy in inhibiting AOB growth. The response patterns of nirS/nirK nitrite-reducing denitrifiers to biochar and/or DMPP addition varied among clades. Notably, biochar and/or DMPP increased the abundance of nosZI and nosZII-N2O reducers, but nosZI-clade taxa were more closely associated with reducing N2O emission than nosZII taxa. Overall, our findings proved that the dynamics of AOB and nosZI-N2O reducers resulting from the addition of biochar and/or DMPP played a key role in governing soil N2O emissions.

The results showed that cellulose anionic hydrogels with suitable carboxylate contents as plant growth regulators could be beneficial for seed germination and growth. Moreover, they presented preferable antifungal activity during the breeding and growth of the sesame seed breeding.

The supported ionic specie was certified as a highly active and magnetically recoverable catalyst for the synthesis of various substituted ureas and structurally diverse N-heterocyclic compounds. The catalyst can be readily recovered by external magnetie and be reused for 6 times without significant loss in catalytic activity. Ionic tagged catalyst performs much better than its ionic-free counterpart in organic transformations.

Here, we report an iron(II)/cobalt(II) dual catalytic system for the syntheses of distally unsaturated amide derivatives. The transformation proceeds through an iron nitrenoid-mediated 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer (1,5-HAT) mechanism. Subsequently, the radical intermediate undergoes hydrogen atom abstraction from vicinal methylene by a cobaloxime catalyst, efficiently yielding beta,gamma- or gamma,delta-unsaturated amide derivatives under mild conditions. The efficiency of Co-mediated HAT can be tuned by varying different auxiliaries, highlighting the generality of this protocol. Remarkably, this desaturation protocol is also amenable to practical scalability, enabling the synthesis of unsaturated carbamates and ureas, which can be readily converted into various valuable molecules.

Rats were divided into a normal group (NC) and hypercholesterolemia induced groups: hypercholesterolemia control group (PC), simvastatin group (SV) (10 mg/kg) and EAMMS extract groups at different dosages of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Blood serum and tissues were collected for haematological, biochemical, histopathological, and enzyme analysis. Total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), urea, creatinine, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, as well as enzymes of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2), were measured. Feeding rats with high cholesterol diet for eight weeks resulted in a significantly (p < 0.05) increased of TC, TG, LDL-C, AST, ALT and MDA levels. Meanwhile, the administration of EAMMS extract (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) and simvastatin (10 mg/kg) significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the levels of TC, TG, LDL-C and MDA compared to rats in the PC group. Furthermore, all EAMMS and SV-treated groups showed a higher HDL-C level compared to both NC and PC groups. No significant difference was found in the level of ALT, AST, urea and creatinine between the different dosages in EAMMS extracts. Treatment with EAMMS also exhibited the highest inhibition activity of enzyme HMGCR and ACAT2 as compared to the control group. From the histopathological examination, liver tissues in the PC group showed severe steatosis than those fed with EAMMS and normal diet. Treatment with EAMMS extract ameliorated and reduced the pathological changes in the liver. No morphological changes showed in the kidney structure of both control and treated groups. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that EAMMS extract has anti-hypercholesterolemia properties and could be used as an alternative treatment for this disorder.

Here, we investigated the responses and the relative contributions of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), anaerobic ammonium oxidizing (anammox) bacteria and denitrifying bacteria after spiking urea into mangrove sediments incubated in a laboratory microcosm experiment for four weeks. During incubation, the diversity, abundances and transcription levels of the hzo genes for anammox bacteria, amoA genes for AOA and AOB, and nirS genes for denitrifying bacteria were monitored using targeted gene clone library analyses and quantitative PCR assays at the DNA and RNA levels. The results showed that mangrove sediments harbour habitat-specific anammox bacteria which related to Candidatus Scalindua and Candidatus Kuenenia clades. Mangrove specific AOA related to deep branched clades within Candidatus Nitrososphaera and Candidatus Nitrosotalea, and AOB related to Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira were also detected in the collected sediment samples. Growth and activity of AOA were detected at all levels of amendment of nitrogen input, where as AOB growth was detectable only at the high-level nitrogen input (1.5 mg urea per gramof dry sediment) with no amoA transcripts and lower abundance than AOA. The abundance and transcription levels of the nirS gene were higher (similar to 1000 times) than those of the hzo gene in all groups. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated that the abundance of both AOA and AOB amoA genes had a significant positive correlation with the nirS gene (p < 0.01). These results indicated that nitrification (primarily mediated by the AOA)-denitrification process played the most important role in nitrogen removal from the amendment of nitrogen short-term input in the mangrove sediments.

In this study, TiO2 nanotube arrays were synthesized using an electrochemical anodization method, and g-C3N4 nanoparticles were grown in situ on TiO2 nanotubes using three thermal polymerization strategies. Compared with pure TiO2, the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterojunctions exhibited different degrees of enhancement in photoelectrochemical performance under stimulated solar light. The TNT-L heterojunction fabricated by urea solution exhibited excellent photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity and followed a Z-scheme mechanism, which is beneficial for carrier separation and maintaining the original redox capacity of each component.

J	Hussain, N; Puzari, P				Hussain, Nayab; Puzari, Panchanan			A novel method for electrochemical determination of creatinine in human urine based on its reaction with 2-nitrobenzaldehyde using a glassy carbon electrode	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY												In this work, an electrochemical method for sensitive determination of creatinine has been reported based on its reaction with 2-nitrobenzaldehyde and using differential pulse voltammetry technique. A plausible mechanism of the reaction has been proposed and successful application of this method for creatinine detection in a real sample (human urine) has also been demonstrated. The mechanism is indicative of the formation of multiple electroactive species in the process. The linear range of detection being 1-25 mM, with LOD of 0.50 mM and an excellent R-2 value of 0.99, was suitable enough for the detection of creatinine in human urine. Interference studies of urea, uric acid, glucose, ascorbic acid and dopamine were done and found to be within the acceptable limit. All the components except uric acid showed an interference of less than 3.2%, while uric acid showed maximum interference of 8.4%. Its robustness, high selectivity, good sensitivity, and low detection limit have projected it as a promising new tool for a point-of-care testing device. [GRAPHICS] .

J	Challagulla, S; Roy, S				Challagulla, Swapna; Roy, Sounak			The role of fuel to oxidizer ratio in solution combustion synthesis of TiO2 and its influence on photocatalysis	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH												Recently, solution combustion synthetic approach has emerged as a potential route to synthesize a wide range of catalytic oxides. Nano TiO2 was synthesized by solution combustion methods using glycine, urea, and oxalyldihydrazide as fuels. X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy analyses revealed the structural and morphological differences of TiO2 synthesized with different fuels. The oxidizer to fuel ratio from lean to rich conditions also played a crucial role in determining the polymorphic percentage concentration in the synthesized TiO2 powders. However, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy studies did not show any significant differences in the electronic properties of the synthesized TiO2. As the polymorphic composite phases synergistically influence the catalytic performances, photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) and photo hydrogen production were studied with the synthesized catalysts. The synergistic role crucially depended on the specific reaction. The presence of different TiO2 polymorphs due to difference in fuels during combustion controlled the photocatalytic efficiency of the catalysts toward MB degradation and hydrogen production.

Herein, we developed a scale-up and sustainable method to fabricate gram-quantities of highly dispersed cobalt nanocatalysts sheathed in multilayered N-doped graphene (Co@NG) by using a biomacromolecule carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as a raw material. The ionic gelation of CMC, urea and Co2+ ions leads to uniform dispersion and chelation of different species, consequently resulting in the formation of highly distributed Co nanoparticles (NPs) (10.91 nm) with N-enriched graphene shells in the solid-state thermolysis process. The usage of urea as a non-corrosive activation agent can introduce a porous belt-like nanostructure and abundant doped nitrogen. Among all the prepared catalysts in this work, the optimized Co@NG-6 with the largest specific surface area (627 m(2) g(-1)), the most and strongest basic sites, and the highest proportion of pyridinic-N (37.6%) and mesopores exhibited excellent catalytic activity (99% yield of 2-methoxy-p-cresol) for base-free transfer hydrodeoxygenation (THD) of vanillin using bioderived formic acid (FA) as a H source at 160 degrees C for 6 h. The poisoning tests and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra verified that the strong interaction between N atoms and encapsulated Co NPs provided synergistic effects, which were essential for the outstanding catalytic performance of Co@NG-6. The deuterium kinetic isotope effect study clearly demonstrated that the formation of Co-H(-)via beta-hydride elimination and protonation was the rate-determining step, and protic N-H+ and hydridic Co-H- were considered to be active intermediate species in the THD reaction. Furthermore, Co@NG-6 was highly stable for recycling owing to the graphene shells preventing Co NPs from corrosion and aggregation.

However, leveraging the MET process to enable the release of therapeutic gases has been largely unexplored. Herein, we report the bio-inspired activation of a series of UV-absorbing N-nitrosamide derivatives (NOA) under red light exposure, enabling the quantitative release of nitric oxide (NO) gasotransmitter via an MET process. The cornerstone of our design is the covalent linkage of a 2,4-dinitroaniline moiety, which acts as an electron mediator to the N-nitrosamide groups. This facilitates efficient electron transfer from the excited palladium(II) meso-tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP) photocatalyst and the selective activation of NOA. Our approach has been validated with distinct photocatalysts and various N-nitrosamides, including those derived from carbamates, amides, and ureas. Notably, the modulation of the linker length between the electron mediator and N-nitrosamide groups serves as a regulatory mechanism for controlling NO release kinetics. Moreover, this biomimetic NO release platform demonstrates effective operation under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and it enables localized delivery of NO under physiological conditions, exhibiting significant anticancer efficacy within the phototherapeutic window and enhanced selectivity towards tumor cells.

At temperatures >400 degrees C, N2O formation was significant over VWT but <5 ppm over FeZ/VWT catalysts with the FeZ 8%. Unfortunately, all these FeZ-promoted catalysts disclosed a decrease in deNO(x)ing performances, due to an enhanced NH3 oxidation into NO. At temperatures >350 degrees C, the chemically-combined VWT-based FeZ systems could facilitate both N2O reduction with NH3 and N2O decomposition, thereby suppressing N2O emissions in NH3-SCR reaction.

The Ag loading significantly affected the de-NOx performance and C3H6 conversion; a low Ag loading in the catalyst (less than 2 wt% Ag) afforded superior de-NOx performance compared to that obtained with more than 4 wt% Ag, owing to the lack of agglomeration of Ag particles on the support (Ag/Al2O3) in the former. Considering the C3H6 slip, a very high reaction temperature (above 525 degrees C) was required for complete C3H6 oxidation. A combination of Ag/ Al2O3 and CuSn/ZSM-5 allowed complete C3H6 oxidation below 350 degrees C owing to the superior C3H6 oxidation ability of CuSn/ZSM-5, which is the merit of the combined system compared with Ag/Al2O3 or CuSn/ZSM-5 used individually. The best catalytic configuration is the sequential arrangement of 1Ag/Al2O3 + 2Cu1Sn/ZSM-5, which could simultaneously reduce NOx, C3H6, and H-2 over a wider temperature window ranging from 300-600 degrees C. Notably, the reduced NOx was almost entirely reduced to N-2 with negligible generation of N2O, NH3, and HCNO. (C) 2020 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

J	Guo, L; Duan, B; Zhang, LN				Guo, Lin; Duan, Bo; Zhang, Lina			Construction of controllable size silver nanoparticles immobilized on nanofibers of chitin microspheres via green pathway	NANO RESEARCH												In the present work, nanofibrous chitin microsphere (NCM) was prepared via sol-gel transition from a chitin solution dissolved in a NaOH/urea aqueous system at low temperatures. Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized via an in situ reduction of silver nitrate using trisodium citrate dehydrate and were immobilized on chitin nanofibers to obtain composite microspheres that consist of nanofibers and AgNPs (NCM-Ag). The size of AgNPs could be controlled in the range of 10 to 70 nm, depending on the concentration of AgNO3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analyses showed that the chitin nanofibers have a strong affinity toward AgNPs, resulting from the interaction between the acetamino group of chitin and the AgNPs. The NCM-Ag exhibited a perfect nanoporous structure and high surface area, as well as high stability in organic solvents. Moreover, in the catalytic epoxidation of olefin (particularly, the conversion of styrene to styrene epoxide), NCM-Ag exhibited an excellent selectivity of up to 90%. Converting chitin powder into chitin microspheres using an environmentally friendly technique is a green process, which is beneficial for the large-scale synthesis of industrial products. More importantly, this work provides a green synthetic pathway for the construction of size-controlled noble metal nanoparticles immobilized on nanofiber support, which have a wide range of potential applications.

Characterization results show that an appropriate doping ratio of Y can be embedded into in-planes of g-C3N4. The Y/g-C3N4 catalysts are characterized by hierarchical porosity, large specific surface area, and large pore volume. Introduction of Y species effectively extends the spectral response of g-C3N4 from ultraviolet to visible region and decelerates the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.

The incorporation of acetylacetone (acac) into the conjugated polymer matrix g-C(3)N(4)derived from urea (UCN) can tune the electronic structure effectively. As a result, the modified g-C(3)N(4)showed a narrowed band gap and enhanced charge carrier migration and separation. Meanwhile, the high utilization ratio of visible light leads to efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, and an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) as high as 18.8% at 450 nm is achieved, exceeding that of most of the previously reported doped g-C(3)N(4)photocatalysts. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations certify the proposed structure of g-C(3)N(4)by incorporation of acetylacetone and explain the enhanced ability to harvest photons due to the introduction of an electron push-pull system into the CN network. In addition, the incorporation of acac into g-C(3)N(4)is also found to be applicable to other precursors (dicyandiamide and thiourea) through similar synthetic routes. Optical absorption under visible light is extended similarly, highlighting the universality of the current strategy. The work provides a route of organic chemistry to design and synthesize functional g-C(3)N(4)with high photocatalytic performance.

Adsorption and degradation are effective methods for TC removal. This study developed nitrogen-doped magnetic carbon microspheres (N-Fe3O4@CMSs) using starch and Fe3O4 as precursors, with urea as the nitrogen source. Morphology characterization revealed uniform spheres with Fe3O4 particles attached. Nitrogen doping increased mesopores and carbon graphitization. Adsorption tests showed that N-Fe3O4@CMSs adsorbed up to 96.43 mg center dot g(-1) of TC, with a removal rate of 0.01445 min(-1). Adding K2S2O8 accelerated the rate to 0.1075 min(-1), achieving 98.35 % removal in 20 min. N-Fe3O4@CMSs exhibit exceptional TC removal efficiency, achieving over 73 % removal after 3 cycles. Mechanisms include adsorption and degradation, involving monolayer adsorption and reactive species generation. This novel material demonstrates adsorption, degradation, separation, and reusable capabilities. It has promising potential in removing antibiotics and other pollutants from aqueous environments.

Here in this regard, we use commercially exhausted urea for the fabrication activated carbons and graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) layered structures doped with sulphur to accumulate activated carbon with S for pollutants degradation using the thermal decomposition method. The synthesized material contains activated carbon in a small amount, which does not accumulate with nitrogen to form GCN and cause a higher energy bandgap (3.31 eV - 3.38 eV). However, through S, we have modified the bandgap and reduced it to (2.84 eV - 3.06 eV) for visible light. The S with activated carbon system along with GCN enhances the synergetic contribution in degradation. The reaction constant (K) is increased from (3.5 x 10-3 - 4.1 x 10-2) owing to synergic effect. Most notably, a significant amount of sulphur accumulated with activated carbon and GCN, altered the charge transfer route and enhanced optical absorption and higher photocatalytic activity, and i considered a novel approach for environmental remediation.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY					7th Brazilian Congress of Biometeorology, Ambience, Behavior and Animal Welfare (CBBiomet-Jaboticabal)	JUL 30-AUG 02, 2017	Sao Paulo State Univ, Sao Paulo, BRAZIL		Sao Paulo State Univ			Soil moisture and compaction, and source of N and bovine urine can reduce methane (CH4) rates from agricultural soils. However, the magnitude of the effect is unknown in tropical soil under different conditions, as well as the potential of different urine-N concentration, volume, and sources of N in such an effect. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different soil conditions (moist, dry, compacted, moist-dung, moist-dung-compacted), N concentration in urine (2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 g N L-1), volume of urine (25, 50, 100, and 200 ml kg(-1) dry soil), and source of N (ammonium, nitrate, and urea) on CH4 emissions. A tropical Ferralsol soil from marandu-grass pasture was incubated during 106 days and the CH4 concentration determined by gas chromatography. The CH4 rates varied significantly according to the soil conditions when manipulated the urine-N (p < 0.01) and averaged 0.75, - 0.50, 1.14, 6.23, and 8.17 mu g C-CH4 m(-2) h(-1)for the moist, dry, compacted, moist-dung, and moist-dung-compacted soil, respectively, and, not responded to the level of N (p = 0.73) averaging 2.57 mu g C-CH4 m(-2) h(-1). When evaluated, the volumes of urine cumulative CH4 averages were - 0.52, - 1.24, - 0.88, 14.48, and 18.56 mu g C-CH4 m(-2) h(-1) for the moist, dry, compacted, moist-dung, and moist-dung-compacted, respectively. Soils were affected by soil treatments (p < 0.001) but not by urine volumes (p = 0.30). The source of N did not influence the CH4 rates (p = 0.1) averaging 0.88, - 1.26, and - 1.19 mu g C-CH4 m(-2) h(-1) respectively, for urea, nitrate, and ammonium. The CH4 fluxes in tropical Ferralsols are controlled by the soil characteristics and dung addition.

Tandem copper and photoredox catalysis in photocatalytic alkene difunctionalization reactions	BEILSTEIN JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY												Oxidative alkene difunctionalization reactions are important in synthetic organic chemistry because they can install polar functional groups onto simple non-polar alkene moieties. Many of the most common methods for these reactions rely upon the reactivity of pre-oxidized electrophilic heteroatom donors that can often be unstable, explosive, or difficult to handle. Herein, we describe a method for alkene oxyamination and diamination that utilizes simple carbamate and urea groups as nucleophilic heteroatom donors. This method uses a tandem copper-photoredox catalyst system that is operationally convenient. The identity of the terminal oxidant is critical in these studies. Ag(I) salts proved to be unique in their ability to turn over the copper cocatalyst without deleteriously impacting the reactivity of the organoradical intermediates.

Feeding Calcium-Ammonium Nitrate to Lactating Dairy Goats: Milk Quality and Ruminal Fermentation Responses	ANIMALS												Simple Summary Calcium-ammonium nitrate (CAN) has been extensively used as a potential methane inhibitor for ruminants; however, there is still a need for studies focused on investigating its effects on the fatty acid profile and antioxidant capacity of milk, especially from dairy goats. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of CAN on nutrient digestibility, ruminal fermentation, and milk quality of lactating Saanen goats. Treatments consisted of a control diet (without CAN), 10 g of CAN per kg of dry matter, and 20 g of CAN per kg of dry matter. Supplemental CAN did not affect feed intake, digestibility of nutrients, and most ruminal fermentation parameters. Yields and composition of milk were not affected, and minor treatment effects were observed on the milk fatty acid profile. Milk antioxidant capacity was altered by increased conjugated dienes and reduced thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, along with greater concentrations of nitrate and nitrite residues in milk. Calcium-ammonium nitrate can be fed to lactating dairy goats up to 20 g per kg of dry matter without negative effects on nutrient digestibility and milk composition; however, it increased the concentration of conjugated dienes in milk, which may induce its faster lipid oxidation. We aimed to investigate the effects of calcium-ammonium nitrate (CAN) fed to lactating dairy goats on dry matter (DM) intake, digestibility of nutrients, milk properties (composition, antioxidant capacity, fatty acid profile, and nitrate residues), and ruminal fermentation parameters. Twelve lactating Saanen goats averaging 98.5 +/- 13.1 days in milk, 53.5 +/- 3.3 kg of body weight, and 2.53 +/- 0.34 kg of milk/day were randomly assigned in four 3 x 3 Latin squares to receive the following diets: a control group (without CAN) with 7.3 g/kg DM of urea (URE), 10 g/kg DM of CAN (CAN10), and 20 g/kg DM of CAN (CAN20). Each period lasted 21 days, with 14 days for diet adaptation and seven days for data and sample collection. The DM intake, digestibility of nutrients, yields of milk, 3.5% fat-corrected milk, and energy-corrected milk were not affected by treatments. Similarly, there were no treatment effects on the yields and concentrations of milk fat, true protein, and lactose, along with minor effects on milk fatty acid profile. Total antioxidant capacity in milk was unaffected by treatments; however, concentration of conjugated dienes increased, while thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in milk decreased linearly. Nitrate and nitrite residues in milk were elevated by treatments, while the total of volatile fatty acids and ammonia-N concentration in the rumen were unaffected. Collectively, feeding CAN (up to 20 g/kg of DM) to lactating dairy goats did not affect feed intake, nutrient digestibility, and milk composition; however, it may increase milk lipid oxidation, as evidenced by increased conjugated diene concentration.

J	Sen, A; Vyas, N; Pandey, B; Jaccob, M; Rajaraman, G				Sen, Asmita; Vyas, Nidhi; Pandey, Bhawana; Jaccob, Madhavan; Rajaraman, Gopalan			Mechanistic Insights on the Formation of high-valent Mn<SUP>III/IV</SUP>=O Species Using Oxygen as Oxidant: A Theoretical Perspective	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												High-valent metal-oxo species are of great interest as they serve as a robust catalyst for various organic transformations, and at the same time, they offer significant insight into the reactivity of various metalloenzymes. Formation of Mn-Oxo species is of great interest as they are involved in the Oxygen Evolving Complex of Photosystem II, and various bio-mimic models were synthesized to understand its reactivity. In this context, using urea decorated amine ligands, Borovik et al. have reported the facile formation of Mn-III=O and Mn-IV=O species from [Mn(II)H(2)buea](2-) (here H2buea=tris[(N '-tert-butylureayl)-N-ethyl]amine) precursor complex using oxygen as the oxidant. While reactivity of these species is thoroughly studied, mechanism of formation of such species is scarcely explored. In this work, we have attempted to establish the formation of these species from the Mn-II precursor using the experimental conditions. Our calculations reveal the following fundamental steps in the formation of such species: i) O-2 activation by Mn-II lead to formation of Mn-II-superoxide species wherein the oxidation state of the Mn-II found to be intact upon O-2 binding facilitated by the deprotonated nitrogen atom present in the cavity (ii) in the second step, superoxo species is converted to Mn-II-hydroperoxo species, [Mn(II)H(2)buea(OOH)](2-) using dimethylacetamide solvent as source for HAT reaction (iii) presence of water molecule found to aid the O-O bond cleavage in [Mn(II)H(2)buea(OOH)](2-) species leading to the formation of the putative Mn-III=O species, [Mn(III)H(3)buea(O)](2-) (iv) one-electron oxidation of Mn-III=O, leads to the formation of [Mn(IV)H(3)buea(O)](-) species and this step is endothermic and need some external oxidants for its formation. While various spin-states and their roles are explored, our calculations reveal that the Mn atom prefers to be in the high-spin state across the potential energy surface studied. However, the nature of the formation is strongly correlated to the spin state arising from the radical nature present in the O-2 moiety and also in the deprotonated nitrogen atom. This offers a unique multistate reactivity channel for the formation these species easing various kinetic barriers across the potential energy surface. Further, we have also computed the spectral parameters for the experimentally observed species, which are in agreement with the reported data offering confidence on the mechanism established. To this end, our study unveils a facile formation of high-valent Mn-Oxo species using O-2 as oxidant and role of water molecules in the formation of such species, and these mechanistic insights are likely to have implications beyond the example studied here.					; , JACCOB/D-8050-2014	Rajaraman, Gopalan/0000-0001-6133-3026; , JACCOB/0000-0002-2632-4076													0021-2148	1869-5868				OCT	2020	60	10-11			SI		973	986		10.1002/ijch.201900142	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ijch.201900142		FEB 2020											WOS:000513690400001

Despite their potential, Zn-O-2 batteries are not yet widely used in industrial applications due to their low cyclability and dependence on Platinum Group Metals (PGM). To address these issues, in this research, the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts based on Mn is proposed. While widely documented electrocatalysts like MnO2 demonstrate excellent catalytic behavior for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR), they lack Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) capacity. In this study, bifunctional electrocatalysts are obtained through the incorporation of N (nitrogen) and C (carbon) by using urea and surfactants. The chemical, microstructural, and electrochemical properties of these electrocatalysts were thoroughly evaluated. The results reveal that these materials exhibit a promising catalytic capacity for both ORR and OER and a stable charge-discharge cycling performance reaching a discharge capacity of 800 mAh g(-1).

Their flexible structures, due to only one methylene chain bridging the urea moieties, endow them with different properties to those of cucurbiturils, such as solubility in common organic solvents, accommodation of anions in their cavities, and so on. In this review, we survey the synthesis of hemicucurbiturils and their derivatives involving cyclohexylhemi-cucurbiturils, bambusurils, and biotinurils, as well as their supramolecular properties of host-guest interactions, molecular recognitions, and supramolecular catalysis. The review aimed to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the new class of macrocylic compounds for both investigators already engaged in this research field and those interested in gaining insight into these macrocycles.					zhu, tao/KHY-3114-2024														1570-193X	1875-6298					2018	15	4					274	282		10.2174/1570193X15666171228150315	http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1570193X15666171228150315													WOS:000434203300003

After characterization by various physical methods, such as SEM, XRD, and FTIR, the copper oxide particles were employed for the fabrication of the gas sensor. The latter was made up of a thick film of copper oxide on alumina plate, having printed interdigitated gold electrodes. Electrical properties of the sensor material were evaluated as a function of the temperature, which indicated its semiconductor behavior. On exposing to ammonia gas, the sensor responded in the form of a decrease in electrical resistance in a reproducible manner. Reproducibility in performance was attributed to the use of monodispersed particles of copper oxide in the fabrication of sensor. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The resulting catalyst exhibited remarkable plasmonic photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation. In comparison with benchmark rutile TiO2 and g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure catalysts, the first-order reaction rate constant of the developed catalyst improved approximately 34.2 and 6.5 times, respectively. The doping concentration of carbon and the crystal size of TiN nanoparticles, predominantly influenced by the amount of urea and calcination temperature, were identified as crucial factors governing the plasmonic photocatalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the introduction of carbon-sp bands into the TiN band structure promoted interband excitation of electrons and facilitated the generation of hotter holes, thereby enhancing the degradation of dyes and ultimately contributing to the superior photocatalytic activity observed.

A novel carbon quantum dots compound containing nitrogen and phosphorus (NP-CQDs) was obtained by reacting citric acids, with urea and phytic acids. The density of the film was increased, and the water vapor permeation was reduced by the presence of NP-CQDs. The introduction of 4 wt% NP-CQDs increased the water contact angle of the CS film from 79.2 degrees to 105.8 degrees. The shielding on UV-A and UV-B transmittance was increased with the NP-CQDs loading. The film containing 4 wt% NP-CQDs blocked more than 90.2% UV-A and 96.5% UV-B; however, it only blocked 26.8% visible light. It also exhibited better antibacterial activity to both E. coli and S. aureus than the control CS film. This work provided a feasible way to prepare multifunctional bio-safe film.

Then, gold nanoparticle (AuNP) decorated rGO@Ni-MOF (rGO@Ni-MOF/AuNP) were obtained through the electrodeposition. The morphology and structure of rGO@ Ni-MOF/AuNP were characterized by SEM, FTIR, and XRD. The rGO@Ni-MOF/AuNP modified electrode was used for the detection of dopamine. Combining the catalysis from Ni-MOF and AuNP with the conductivity of rGO endowed rGO@ Ni-MOF/AuNP with synergetic high catalytic activity to the electrochemical oxidation of dopamine. The developed modified electrode had a good linear relationship with dopamine in the concentration range of 0.5 similar to 120 mu M, and the detection limit was 0.33 mu M (S/N = 3). Additionally, the potential interferents, electrode stability, reproducibility, and practical applications were also studied and satisfactory results were obtained.																			0008-4042	1480-3291				MAY	2021	99	5					465	473		10.1139/cjc-2020-0292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjc-2020-0292													WOS:000648535100004

Yerba mate has presented a potential use as preventive and therapeutic agent on diabetes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of yerba mate on different tissues of diabetic rats, focusing on energetic metabolism. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin, followed by daily yerba mate treatment. After 30 days, the animals were euthanized to evaluate metabolic parameters on liver, adipose tissue, muscle and serum. The results showed mate treatment promoted a decrease in retroperitoneal adipose tissue in healthy animals. Muscle weight returned to control levels in diabetic rats treated with mate. There was improvement on serum glucose, creatinine, urea and total protein levels associated with mate treatment. Muscle parameters, such as glucose uptake and carbon dioxide production, were improved by mate treatment to control levels. The results evidenced the beneficial actions mate can have on metabolic disturbances of diabetes.

Nitrogen uptake rates and phytoplankton composition across contrasting North Atlantic Ocean coastal regimes north and south of Cape Hatteras	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Understanding nitrogen (N) uptake rates respect to nutrient availability and the biogeography of phytoplankton communities is crucial for untangling the complexities of marine ecosystems and the physical, biological, and chemical forces shaping them. In the summer of 2016, we conducted measurements of bulk microbial uptake rates for six 15N-labeled substrates: nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, urea, cyanate, and dissolve free amino acids across distinct marine provinces, including the continental shelf of the Mid-and South Atlantic Bights (MAB and SAB), the Slope Sea, and the Gulf Stream, marking the first instance of simultaneously measuring six different N uptake rates in this dynamic region. Total measured N uptake rates were lowest in the Gulf Stream followed by the SAB. Notably, the MAB exhibited significantly higher N uptake rates compared to the SAB, likely due to the excess levels of pre-existing phosphorus present in the MAB. Together, urea and nitrate uptake contributed approximately 50% of the total N uptake across the study region. Although cyanate uptake rates were consistently low, they accounted for up to 11% of the total measured N uptake at some Gulf Stream stations. Phytoplankton groups were identified based on specific pigment markers, revealing a dominance of diatoms in the shelf community, while Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus, and pico-eukaryotes dominated in oligotrophic Gulf Stream waters. The reported uptake rates in this study were mostly in agreement with previous studies conducted in coastal waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. This study suggests there are distinct regional patterns of N uptake in this physically dynamic region, correlating with nutrient availability and phytoplankton community composition. These findings contribute valuable insights into the intricate interplay of biological and chemical factors shaping N dynamics in disparate marine ecosystems.

After that, the dry leaves of M. oleifera were grinded into fine powder and extracted using water extraction system. Then, different volumes (0.5, 1 and 2 mL) of M. Oleifera were blended with constant volume of Au-NPs (1 mL). Both Au-NPs and M. oleifera extract loaded AuNPs were investigated using transmission electron microscope (TEM) that illustrated the deposition of M. Oleifera onto Au-NPs. The experimental study was performed on seventy male albino rats alienated into seven groups. Group I healthy rats, group II injected with one dose of cisplatin (CisPt), groups from III to VII treated groups received CisPt then received M. Oleifera leaves extract alone and /or Au-NPs with different ratios and concentrations. After the experiment' time, serum urea and creatinine, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrotic factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were evaluated as markers of renal nephrotoxicity. The kidneys of rats were excised for malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assessments.Induction of CisPt showed a highly significant disturbance in oxidant/anti-oxidant balance and inducing inflammatory cascades supporting nephrotoxicity, while treatment with M. Oleifera leaves extract, Au-NPs, and the different concentrations of the extract loaded on Au-NPs had a crucial role in attenuating oxidative stress, enhancing antioxidant systems, and reducing inflammatory biomarkers, although the most significant results showed a powerful scavenging activity against nephrotoxicity induced by CisPt was obtained with M. Oleifera leaves extract loaded on Au-NPs with a concentration of 2:1 respectively.

In nonruminants, activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) can improve cell damage and reduce the overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. As a downstream target of TFEB, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1 alpha, gene name PPARGC1A) is a critical regulator of oxidative metabolism. Nuciferine (Nuc), a major bioactive compound isolated from the lotus leaf, has been reported to possess hepatoprotective activity. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether Nuc could protect bovine hepatocytes from FFAinduced lipotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms. A mixture of FFA was diluted in RPMI-1640 basic medium containing 2% low fatty acid bovine serum albumin to treat hepatocytes. Bovine hepatocytes were isolated from newborn calves and treated with various concentrations of FFA mixture (0, 0.3, 0.6, or 1.2 mM) or Nuc (0, 25, 50, or 100 mu M), as well as co -treated with 1.2 mM FFA and different concentrations of Nuc. For the experiments of gene silencing, bovine hepatocytes were transfected with small interfering RNA targeted against TFEB or PPARGC1A for 36 h followed by treatment with 1.2 mM FFA for 12 h in presence or absence of 100 mu M Nuc. The results revealed that FFA treatment decreased protein abundance of nuclear TFEB, cytosolic TFEB, total (t)-TFEB, lysosomeassociated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and PGC1 alpha and mRNA abundance of LAMP1, but increased phosphorylated (p)-TFEB. In addition, FFA treatment increased the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and decreased the activities of catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) in bovine hepatocytes. Moreover, FFA administration enhanced the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) in the medium of FFA-treated hepatocytes, but reduced the content of urea. In FFA-treated bovine hepatocytes, Nuc administration increased TFEB nuclear localization and the protein abundance of t-TFEB, LAMP1, and PGC-1 alpha and mRNA abundance of LAMP1, decreased the contents of MDA and H2O2 and the protein abundance of pTFEB, and enhanced the activities of CAT and GSHPx in a dose -dependent manner. Consistently, Nuc administration reduced the activities of ALT, AST, and LDH and increased the content of urea in the medium of FFA-treated hepatocytes. Importantly, knockdown of TFEB reduced the protein abundance of p-TFEB, t-TFEB, LAMP1, and PGC-1 alpha and mRNA abundance of LAMP1, and impeded the beneficial effects of Nuc on FFA-induced oxidative damage in bovine hepatocytes. In addition, PPARGC1A silencing did not alter Nucinduced nuclear translocation of TFEB, increase of the protein abundance of t-TFEB, LAMP1, and PGC-1 alpha and mRNA abundance of LAMP1, or decrease of the protein abundance of p-TFEB, whereas it partially reduced the beneficial effects of Nuc on FFA-caused oxidative injury. Taken together, Nuc exerts protective effects against FFA-induced oxidative damage in bovine hepatocytes through activation of the TFEB/ PGC-1 alpha signaling pathway.

The 80% ethanol extracts of Herpetospermum caudigerum were partitioned with chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol, respectively. Male Kunming mice were divided into 13 groups with 16 mice in each group: a control group fed with water, 9 groups treated with 3 fractions of Herpetospermum caudigerum (chloroform fraction, ethyl acetate fraction and n-butanol fraction) at dose of 80, 160 and 320 mg/kg for the low-dose group, medium-dose group and high-dose group, 3 herpetrione (HPE) treated groups fed with HPE at dose of 15, 30, and 60 mg/kg for the low-dose group, medium-dose group and high-dose group. All animals were treated once per day for 30 days. Anti-fatigue activity was assessed through the forced swimming test and serum biochemical parameters including blood lactic acid (BLA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), malondialdehyde (MDA), hepatic glycogen (HG), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) determined following the recommended procedures provided by the commercial kits. Compared with the control group, the lignans extract (ethyl acetate fraction) of Herpetospermum caudigerum and HPE could signifificantly prolonged the exhaustive swimming time (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), and also increased the HG levels (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) and the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx and LDH, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01); BLA and MDA levels were decreased considerably in lignans extract and HPE treated groups (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). HPE also could significantly decrease the BUN contents compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The chloroform and n-butanol fraction showed no effect on swimming time and biochemical parameters. The lignans extract had antifatigue activities and HPE may be partly responsible for the anti-fatigue effects of Herpetospermum caudigerum. The possible mechanisms of anti-fatigue activity were related to the decrease of BUN and BLA, the increase of the HG storage and protecting corpuscular membrane by preventing lipid oxidation via modifying several enzyme activities.

The situation is quite different with soot when use of a trap is not feasible for reasons of cost, space requirements and maintenance. Due to the highly complex soot formation and oxidation process, soot emissions cannot be targeted as easily as NOx. So, how can soot be kept within the limits? In principle, soot can be controlled by allocating sufficient oxygen and establishing good mixing conditions with vaporized fuel. The most effective measures target the injection system, e.g., increasing injection pressure, applying multiple injections, optimizing nozzle geometry. To investigate the impact of very high injection pressure on soot, an advanced injection system with rail pressure capability up to 3000 bar and a Bosch injector was installed at the Large Engines Competence Center (LEC) in Graz. Full load and part load operating points at constant speed and in accordance with the propeller law were investigated at the test bed to quantify the impact of high injection pressure on soot emissions. Test runs were conducted with both SCR and EGR while varying injection timing and air-fuel ratios. Use of a statistical method, design of experiments (DOE), helped reduce the number of tests. Optical investigations of the spray and combustion were conducted. The goal was to obtain soot concentration history traces with the two color method in order to better understand how soot originates and to be able to calibrate 3D CFD (computational fluid dynamics) FIRE spray models for use with injection pressures of up to 3000 bar. Very low soot emissions can be achieved using high pressure injection, even when EGR is applied. DOE results provide a clear picture of the relationships between the parameters and can be used to optimize set values for the whole speed and load range. A reliable spray break up model can be used in further 3D CFD simulation to investigate how to reduce soot emissions.

Direct orange 26 dye environmental degradation: experimental studies (UV, mass, and thermal) in comparison with computational exploration hydrogen bonding analysis of TD-DFT calculations	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING												The importance of this study stems from, it concentrates on new approach applying both practical and theoretical aspects to study structure stability of direct orange dye 26 (DO26) as an important dye widely used for dyeing of cotton or viscose for red orange direct printing. The stable dyes are so difficult to remove, decolorized and/or degrade, in pure solution or in wastewater samples, without using powerful removal environmental techniques electrochemical oxidations suggest and efficiently used in our Lab. Therefore, it is very important to compare between practical thermal and mass results as efficient techniques in studying dye stability, in comparison with theoretical results using Gaussian program for structural stability identification of DO26 dye, via careful inspection of various phenomena detected in its two symmetrical arms around urea center. Direct orange dye 26 (DO26) structure has been studied applying both practical spectroscopic and theoretical investigations. DFT-B3LYP/6-311 + + G(d,p) calculations and the electronic vibrational properties are performed to investigate its structure stability and consequently its degradation and removal from its environmental media. Correlation is found between experimental and calculated data. An intra-molecular hydrogen bonding interaction had been detected and characterized in dye skeleton. The hydrogen bonding present in the dye structure affecting its vibrational properties had been discussed. Natural population analysis like HOMO and LUMO and high-quality molecular electrostatic potential plots along with various electronics had been presented at the same level of theory. Chemical reactivity descriptors from conceptual density functional theory point of view and structure activity relationship descriptor were obtained. The experimental UV/visible, FT-IR, mass and GC-mass spectral data of the dye DO26 (D1) had been presented. These data had been supported by TD-DFT calculations to simulate the experimental spectra with computing the natural transition orbitals (NTO) and the orbital composition. Actually there is a problem that the degradation of this dye in wastewater by different techniques leads to various unknown fragments, but on using theoretical possibilities, it can be expected what happened in practical work.					zayed, mohamed/AAS-5817-2021; zayed, mohamed/C-1108-2009	zayed, mohamed/0000-0003-2425-6329; Abo-Ayad, Zahraa A./0009-0002-0584-3800													1610-2940	0948-5023				NOV	2021	27	11							325	10.1007/s00894-021-04945-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00894-021-04945-4								34671847					WOS:000709327800001

Testing the photoactivity of the prepared catalysts with 4-nitrophenol revealed that ammonium nitrate was the best doping agent with a nominal N-content of 0.8% (w/w), yielding a 5-fold increase in the pseudo-first order constant of 4-nitrophenol disappearance and a 3-fold increase in the pseudo-first order constant of TOC disappearance, with respect to undoped TiO2, when irradiated with LED visible light (>425 nm). In the same experimental conditions, commercial catalysts such as Evonik P25 and mixtures of commercial rutile and brookite failed to work. XRD allowed to identify two crystal phases, i.e. brookite and rutile, and to show that the most active catalyst had the highest brookite and lowest amorphous content, along with the largest rutile crystallites. Through HRTEM, the morphology and crystallinity were further investigated: brookite particles were much smaller and roundish with respect to rutile and the intimate contact between the two phases was also well highlighted. N-doping did not produce oxygen vacancies as shown by Raman spectroscopy; thus, the doping can be considered interstitial rather than substitutional. Surface hydroxylation did not promote oxidation ability, as revealed by TGA-DTA: the most reacting catalyst is the least hydroxylated one. BET revealed that the samples are partially mesoporous (type IV hysteresis), although no template/surfactant was used, and the pore size and volume seemed to affect their activity. UV-vis DRS allowed to extrapolate the band gaps, only slightly narrower for N-doped samples, which, however, showed a pronounced absorption of visible radiation compared to undoped TiO2. Photoluminescence showed that the emission due to electron-hole recombination decreases with the N-loading, eventually reaching a minimum plateau for doping amounts just above the optimal one.

The structure of powders was studied based on their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. The XRD of TS-NPs shows that rutile and anatase are the main phases of TS-NPs for AC:NA and U:MC, respectively. Particle size and histogram of nanopowders were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Optical properties of TS-NPs were calculated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Kramers Kroning (KK) relation. Plasma frequencies of TS-NPs obtained from energy loss functions depend on fuels as a result of changes in crystal structure, particle size distribution, and morphology.

In this work, polyaniline (PANI) sheathed BP was prepared via the electrochemical polymerisation of aniline on BP coated screen printed carbon electrode (i. e., SPCE/BP) which resulted in an efficient, stable electrochemical platform (i. e., SPCE/BP@PANI) with improved properties which was evaluated for electrochemical detection of two model bioanalytes namely, ascorbic acid (AA) and Hydrazine (Hy). The formation of PANI on the SPCE/BP exhibited a pair of stable and well-defined redox peaks indicating the better adsorption energy and fast electron transfer nature of BP as compared to other 2D materials like graphene and transitional metal dichalcogenides. FESEM and XPS studies revealed the formation and uniform growth of PANI on BP surface without any aggregation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses revealed that SPCE/BP@PANI can act as a suitable electrocatalyst material for the sensing of AA and Hy. Thus, SPCE/BP@PANI electrode exhibited low limit of detection (D-L; 1.69 mu M), excellent reproducibility and better selectivity towards AA oxidation over glucose, sucrose, urea, citric acid, sodium, nitrate, nitrite and magnesium with a sensitivity of 3.38 A M-1 cm(-2) (R-2=0.98) in the dynamic range of 10-1100 mu M. The excellent analytical performance of the BP@PANI is plausible due to better adsorption energy and fast electron transfer of BP. Further, SPCE/BP@PANI was also used for successful detection of AA in processed fruit juice with good recovery. Under the optimal DPV conditions, the modified electrode was extended for detection of Hy in a linear range of 100-1500 mu M with sensitivity of 0.09 A M-1 cm(-2) (R-2=0.99) and D-L=89 mu M validating the potential of BP based composites in wide range of electrochemical applications.

The Effects of Oral Quercetin Supplementation on Splanchnic Glucose Metabolism in 1-Week-Old Calves Depend on Diet after Birth	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION												Background: Inadequate colostrum supply results in insufficient intake of macronutrients and bioactive factors, thereby impairing gastrointestinal development and the maturation of glucose metabolism in neonatal calves. The flavonoid quercetin has been shown to have health-promoting properties, including effects in diabetic animals. However, quercetin interacts with intestinal glucose absorption and might therefore exert negative effects in neonates. Objective: We evaluated the interaction between neonatal diet and quercetin feeding on splanchnic glucose metabolism in neonatal calves. Methods: Calves In = 28) were assigned to 4 groups and fed either colostrum or a milk-based formula on days 1 and 2 and supplemented daily with 148 mu mol quercetin aglycone/kg body weight [colostrum with quercetin (CQ+)/formula with quercetin (FQ+)) or without this substance [colostrum without quercetin (CQ-)/formula with quercetin (FQ-)] from days 2-8. From day 3 onward, all calves received milk replacer. A xylose absorption test was performed on day 3, and on day 7, blood samples were collected to study glucose first-pass uptake after [C-13(6)]-glucose feeding and intravenous [6,6-H-2(2)]-glucose bolus injection. Plasma concentrations of metabolites and hormones were measured by taking additional blood samples. A biopsy specimen of the liver was harvested on day 8 to measure the mRNA expression of gluconeogenic enzymes. Results: Higher postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose, lactate, urea, adrenaline, noradrenaline, insulin, and glucagon on day 7 in colostrum-fed calves indicate that metabolic processes were stimulated. Postabsorptive xylose and glucose plasma concentrations each increased by an additional 26%, and splanchnic glucose turnover decreased by 35% in colostrum-fed calves, suggesting improved glucose absorption and lower splanchnic glucose utilization in colostrum-fed calves. Quercetin supplementation resulted in higher noradrenaline concentrations and enhanced peak absorption and oxidation of [C-13(6)]-glucose by 10%. Liver mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA abundance was reduced by 34% in colostrum-deprived calves. Conclusions: Feeding colostrum during the first 2 d of life is crucial for maturation of splanchnic glucose metabolism in calves. Supplementing quercetin improves gastrointestinal absorption capacity, particularly in colostrum-deprived calves.

In this study, we investigated the effects of long-term Tai Chi training on motor symptoms in PD and the underlying mechanisms. Methods: Ninety-five early-stage PD patients were enrolled and randomly divided into Tai Chi (n = 32), brisk walking (n = 31) and no-exercise (n = 32) groups. At baseline, 6 months and 12 months during one-year intervention, all participants underwent motor symptom evaluation by Berg balance scale (BBS), Unified PD rating-scale (UPDRS), Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and 3D gait analysis, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), plasma cytokine and metabolomics analysis, and blood Huntingtin interaction protein 2 (HIP2) mRNA level analysis. Longitudinal self-changes were calculated using repeated measures ANOVA. GEE (generalized estimating equations) was used to assess factors associated with the longitudinal data of rating scales. Switch rates were used for fMRI analysis. False discovery rate correction was used for multiple correction. Results: Participants in the Tai Chi group had better performance in BBS, UPDRS, TUG and step width. Besides, Tai Chi was advantageous over brisk walking in improving BBS and step width. The improved BBS was correlated with enhanced visual network function and downregulation of interleukin-1 beta. The improvements in UPDRS were associated with enhanced default mode network function, decreased L-malic acid and 3-phosphoglyceric acid, and increased adenosine and HIP2 mRNA levels. In addition, arginine biosynthesis, urea cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle and beta oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids were also improved by Tai Chi training. Conclusions: Long-term Tai Chi training improves motor function, especially gait and balance, in PD. The underlying mechanisms may include enhanced brain network function, reduced inflammation, improved amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism and neurotransmitter metabolism, and decreased vulnerability to dopaminergic degeneration.

Carvedilol exacerbate gentamicin-induced kidney mitochondrial alterations in adult rat	EXPERIMENTAL AND TOXICOLOGIC PATHOLOGY												Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic widely used to treat many types of bacterial infections. Although its properties, his clinical use is limited due to the occurrence of nephrotoxicity, which has been related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Carvedilol, an antihypertensive drug with strong antioxidant properties, has been tested in order to prevent gentamicin nephrotoxicity. This study aimed to test this hypothesis using a rat model of gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity. Animals were treated subcutaneously with DMSO (control) (0.4%/kg/24 h bw) for 11 days; with carvedilol (2 mg/kg/24 h bw) for 11 days; with gentamicin (60 mg/kg/24 h bw) for the last 8 days and with carvedilol (2 mg/kg/24 h bw) for 11 days and with gentamicin (60 mg/kg/24 h bw) for the last 8 days. Estimations of urine creatinine, urine carboxylic acids, blood urea, serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate were carried out after the last administered dose of gentamicin. Mitochondria functionality was analyzed by monitoring its bioenergetics function and cardiolipin oxidized products were analyzed by ESI-MS. The kidneys were also examined for morphological changes. Gentamicin caused marked nephrotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction as evidenced by several mitochondrial parameters. Carvedilol did not induce significant changes while the co-treatment exacerbated the negative effect of gentamicin although maintaining ATP levels and membrane potential. Kidneys from gentamicin treated rats, with and without carvedilol, showed necrosis of tubular cells in renal cortex. Higher values on relative abundance of cardiolipin oxidation products identified as [M-2H](2-) ions, at m/z 771 were observed in the groups treated with gentamicin. The observed effects were associated to a possible interaction of carvedilol with F1F0-ATP synthase that merit further investigation. In conclusion, carvedilol may contribute to the exacerbation of renal dysfunction induced by gentamicin, at least in some physiological and biochemical parameters. From a clinical perspective, and until further conclusions, cautious use of both drugs in combination is advised with particular emphasis in patients presenting mitochondrial disorders.

The obtained Fe,N-CDs possessed both peroxidaselike activity and strong fluorescence emission at 450 nm. A dual signal(colorimetry and ratio fluorimetry) method for the determination of H2O2 was developed using Fe,N-CDs and o-phenylenediamine(OPD) as probe. When H2O2 was present,OPD was oxidized to 2,3-diaminophenazine(DAP) under the catalysis of Fe,N-CDs. DAP had a characteristic absorption peak at 420 nm. When excited at 360 nm,DAP had a strong fluorescence emission at 550 nm,quenching the fluorescence of Fe,N-CDs at 450 nm because of the inner filter effect. Results showed that the concentration of H2O2 could not only affect the color of the DAP but also the fluorescence intensity of DAP and Fe,N-CDs. Thus,the absorbance of DAP at 420 nm(A(420))and fluores. cence intensity ratio of DAP and Fe,N-CDs(I-550/I-450) could be used for the quantitative analysis of H2O2. Considering that glucose oxidase can catalyze glucose oxidation to produce H2O2, a colorimetric and ratio fluorescence dual-signal method for glucose detection was further developed. Under the conditions of pH 5.4, temperature 40 degrees C,1.75 mmol/L OPD and reaction time 25 min, A(420) and I-550/I-450 showed good linear relation. ship with the glucose concentration in the range of 1.0-100 mu mol/L, and the detection limits(LOD) for glucose were 0.8(colorimetry)and 0.6(ratio fluorimetry) mu mol/L,respectively. This dual-signal method was applied to the determination of glucose in human serum with satisfactory results.

It resulted in 128.71 mu mol of TE g(-1) of DPPH-RSA and 141.92 mu mol of TE g(-1) of ABTS-RSA. A. hierochuntica presented superior antioxidant activity by inhibiting linoleic acid radicals and chelating oxidation metals. The HPLC analysis resulted in 9 and 21 phenolic acids and 6 and 2 flavonoids in KEE and KAE with a predominance of sinapic and syringic acids, respectively. Intramuscular injection of vit. E + Se and oral administration of KEE, KAE, and KEE + KAE at 250 mg kg(-1) body weight significantly restored serum creatinine, urea, K, total protein, and albumin levels. Additionally, they reduced malondialdehyde (MOD), restored reduced-glutathione (GSH), and enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. KEE, KAE, and KEE + KAE protected the kidneys from CCl4-nephrotoxicity as they mainly attenuated induced oxidative stress. Total nephroprotection was about 83.27%, 97.62%, and 78.85% for KEE, KAE, and KEE + KAE, respectively. Both vit. E + Se and A. hierochuntica extracts attenuated the histopathological alteration in CCl4-treated rats. In conclusion, A. hierochuntica, especially KAE, has the potential capability to restore oxidative stability and improve kidney function after CCl4 acute kidney injury better than KEE. Therefore, A. hierochuntica has the potential to be a useful therapeutic agent in the treatment of drug-induced nephrotoxicity.

To achieve sustainable rice production and resource management, the ways in which applied water and nitrogen affect the root and shoot morpho-physiology, as well as yield, must be understood. In this study, a pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of slow-release nitrogen fertilizer (sulfur-coated urea) application at three levels (light nitrogen (NL), medium nitrogen (NM), and heavy nitrogen (NH)) on the growth, yield, and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of rice grown under three water regimes (wetting and soil saturation (WSS), wetting and moderate drying (WMD) and wetting and severe drying (WSD)). The results revealed that differences in water regimes and fertilizer rates led to significant differences in the roots, shoots, yield, and NUE of rice. Increasing the N dosage by 5% enhanced the root and biomass production by 16% in comparison with that of the other groups. The NHxWSS treatment produced the greatest root length, weight, density, active absorption, and oxidation. However, the integration of WSS x NL generated the maximum value of nitrogen apparent recovery efficiency (63.1% to 67.6%) and the greatest value of nitrogen partial factor productivity (39.9 g g(-1) to 41.13 g g(-1)). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that plants grown under high and medium nitrogen fertilizer rates with WSS had improved leaf mesophyll structure with normal starch grains, clear cell walls, and well-developed chloroplasts with tidy and well-arranged thylakoids. These results show that TEM images are useful for characterizing the nitrogen and water status of leaves in the sub-micrometer range and providing specific information regarding the leaf microstructure. The findings of this study suggest that the application of NHxWSS can produce improvements in growth traits and increase rice yield; however, the NLxWSS treatment led to greater NUE, and the authors recommend its usage in rice agriculture.

A CoO-CuO bimetallic catalyst with a special urchin-like structure was prepared by a hydrothermal urea precipitation method. This carbon nanosphere template method significantly improves the dispersibility of the material. The special urchin-like nanorod structure expands the specific surface area, resulting in excellent adsorption performance and high catalytic performance. The materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The oxidative degradation mechanism of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) using sodium persulfate (SPS) activated by the CoO-CuO double metal oxide catalyst was explored. The synergy between the two metals gives the material a stable and highly catalytic ability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Liver-type fatty acid-binding protein is cytotoxic oxidation products secreted from proximal tubules under ischemia and oxidative stress. Objective To examine renal expression and quantify urinary excretion of L-FABP in catswith renal disease. Animals One hundred and thirty-four client-owned cats including 34 cats with serum creatinine (sCre) values >1.6 mg/dL and 10 other cats that died in clinics. Methods Tissue expressions of L-FABP were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Urinary L-FABP (uL-FABP) and serum L-FABP (sL-FABP) levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-liver-type fatty acid-binding protein antibody immunostained renal sections. Results Feline kidneys express L-FABP. Strong L-FABP signals were observed in the lumens of proximal tubular cells in 5 cats with high uL-FABP excretion, but not in 5 cats with low uL-FABP excretion. In 9 normal cats, uL-FABP index was <1.2 mu g/g urinary creatinine (uCre). High uL-FABP indexes (>10.0 mu g/g uCre) were detected in 7 of 100 cats with low sCre (<1.6 mg/dL) and 18 of 44 cats with high sCre (>1.6 mg/dL). There was a weak correlation between L-FABP index and sCre, serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), or blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and these correlation coefficients were increased by analyzing only data of cats with sCre >1.6 mg/dL. There was a weak correlation between u L-FABP index and sL-FABP in all tested cats, but not in cats with high sCre. Conclusions and Clinical Importance This study demonstrates correlations between L-FABP and current renal biomarkers for chronic kidney disease in cats, such as sCre and SDMA. Liver-type fatty acid-binding protein may be a potential biomarker to predict early pathophysiological events in feline kidneys.

Higher protein intakes have been suggested to counteract this. Objectives: We aimed to elucidate how habituated amounts of protein intake affect the fasted state of, and the stimulatory effect of a protein-rich meal on, protein absorption, whole-body protein turnover, and splanchnic amino acid metabolism. Methods: Twelve men (65-70 y) were included in a double-blinded crossover intervention study, consisting of a 20-d habituation period to a protein intake at the RDA or a high amount [1.1 g . kg lean body mass (LBM)(-)(1) . d(-1) or >2.1 g . kg LBM-1 . d(-1), respectively], each followed by an experimental trial with a primed, constant infusion of D-8-phenylalanine and D-2-tyrosine. Arterial and hepatic venous blood samples were obtained after an overnight fast and repeatedly 4 h after a standardized meal including intrinsically labeled whey protein concentrate and calcium-caseinate proteins. Blood was analyzed for amino acid concentrations and phenylalanine and tyrosine tracer enrichments from which whole-body and splanchnic amino acid and protein kinetics were calculated. Results: High (compared with the recommended amount of) protein intake resulted in a higher fasting whole-body protein turnover with a resultant mean +/- SEM 0.03 +/- 0.01 mu mol . kg LBM-1 . min(-1) lower net balance (P < 0.05), which was not rescued by the intake of a protein-dense meal. The mean +/- SEM plasma protein fractional synthesis rate was 0.13 +/- 0.06%/h lower (P < 0.05) after habituation to high protein. Furthermore, higher fasting and postprandial amino acid removal were observed after habituation to high protein, yielding higher urea excretion and increased phenylalanine oxidation rates (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Three weeks of habituation to high protein intake (>2.1 g protein . kg LBM-1 . d(-1)) led to a significantly higher net protein loss in the fasted state. This was not compensated for in the 4-h postprandial period after intake of a meal high in protein.

Dog food production using curcumin as antioxidant: effects of intake on animal growth, health and feed conservation	ARCHIVES OF ANIMAL NUTRITION												The objectives of this study were to produce dog food containing curcumin replacing synthetic antioxidants, to evaluate its beneficial effects on animal growth and health. Curcumin (100 mg/kg) was added after the extrusion process along with the other micronutrients. The final concentration of curcumin was 32.9 mg/kg. The control feed was composed of the same ingredients without curcumin. After a storage of 6 months, feed composition and pH did not differ; however, the feed with curcumin showed lower protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation and higher total antioxidant capacity. After 2 months of feed production, 12 young Beagle dogs received either curcumin-containing food (n = 6) or the control diet (n = 6). The animals were fed twice a day using individual kennels. Blood samples were taken on d 1, 35 and 42. During the first 30 d of the study, the animals had natural infectious diseases that were controlled with anti-protozoals and antibiotics. Greater numbers of red blood cells were observed in dogs fed with curcumin (d 35 and 45), and there were greater numbers of white blood cells as a consequence of increased neutrophils on d 42. At the end of the experiment, a significant reduction in the number of lymphocytes was observed in dogs that ingested curcumin (d 42), suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect, manifested as a decrease in globulin levels. In the final 15 d of the experiment, the animals were clinical healthy. Higher serum levels of glucose, urea, triglycerides and cholesterol were observed in dogs fed with curcumin. Curcumin increased the activity of several antioxidant enzymes in addition to non-protein thiols and the total antioxidant capacity in the serum, consequently reducing levels of oxygen reactive species. Curcumin supplementation of dogs did not favour growth or weight gain. Neverthless, it was concluded that curcumin improved animal health, with emphasis on the stimulation of the antioxidant system and evidence of an anti-inflammatory effect.

Iridoid glycoside from C. officinalis (IGCO) can resist apoptosis, hyperglycemia, oxidation and so on. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of IGCO on DM-induced testicular damage through inhibition of the AGEs/RAGE/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Materials and methods: A DM model of male Wistar rats was induced with streptozotocin injection (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and high-fat diet. The DM rats were administrated with IGCO at low and high doses (15 and 30 mg/kg, p.o.) for 12 weeks. Testicular damage was evaluated by estimating relative testicular weights, testicular pathohistology, sperm count, live sperm rate, endogenous sex hormone level and activity of testicular marker enzymes. Besides, general diabetic symptoms, renal function, oxidative stress parameters and testicular apoptosis marker were also determined. Finally, the mechanism was explored based on the AGEs/RAGE/p38 MAPK pathway. Results: IGCO effectively mitigated the general symptoms of DM rats including weight loss, polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, elevated blood glucose level and low serum insulin level. Nourishing the kidney evidently, IGCO reduced serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and urine protein excretion, and also markedly protected against DM-induced testicular damage by increasing testis/body weight ratio and live sperm rate, improving the histomorphology of testes, upregulating testosterone, LH, FSH and GnRH levels and preventing the decrease of testicular marker enzymes LDH, ACP and gamma-GT. Moreover, IGCO showed considerable anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects, which downregulated the increase of ROS and MDA levels, restored SOD and CAT activities, and decreased spermatogenic cell apoptosis and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In the end, the increased AGEs, RAGE and p-p38 MAPK protein levels in DM rats were also reversed by IGCO significantly. Conclusions: The kidney tonic IGCO well protected DM rats from testicular damage, which may be related to suppression of the AGEs-RAGE-p38 MAPK pathway.

Different modes of attachment of graphitic carbon nitrides on glassy carbon electrode and their electrocatalytic activity	MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL												The present investigation reveals the attachment of graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (GCNS) on glassy carbon (GC) electrode by adsorption, drop casting and potentiodynamic methods and their electrocatalytic activity. The bulk GCN was derived from urea and then converted into GCNS via water exfoliation aided by sonication. The GCNS was then directly attached to the GC electrode (GCNS-a) by immersing it in GCNS for 12 h. The initial adsorption of GCNS on the GC electrode is similar to Michael's like nucleophilic addition, and subsequent attachment may occur via pi-pi stacking. In the next mode of attachment, GCNS was fabricated by drop casting (GCNS-b) a known quantity of GCNS and dried at room temperature. In the third mode of attachment (GCNS-c), GCNS was fabricated on GC electrode by fifteen potential cycles in 0.1 M H2SO4 containing 1 mg mL-1 GCNS. The GCNS modified by these three different protocols were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The SEM studies reveal that the morphology of GCNS varies with respect to the mode of attachment. The GCNS modified by potential cycling shows termitarium like structure whereas sheet like structure and an aggregated transparent thin sheet were noticed for direct adsorption and drop casting methods, respectively. Among the three different modes of attachments, improved electroactive surface area (EAS) and less charge transfer resistance (RCT) value were obtained for GC/GCNS-c electrode. Further, the GCNS attached by potentiodynamic method exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic performance towards ascorbic acid (ASA), dopamine (DPA) and hydrogen peroxide (HDP) in contrast to GCNS modified by adsorption and drop casting methods. The elevated electrochemical activity was due to larger EAS and lower impedance of GCNS-c electrode. The oxidation current increased linearly increases when increasing the concentration of HDP from 100 nM to 1 mM and the limit of detection was 5.2 nM (S/N = 3). Further, GCNSc electrode also selectively determines HDP in the presence of 500-fold higher concentration of major interferents.

Recent Findings: Eleven human studies published before April 1st, 2021 were identified through database searches (PubMed, Dimensions, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus), and citation chaining (Citationchaser). The sample sizes of these studies ranged from 40 to 965, involving children and adolescents (n = 3), nonpregnant adults (n = 5), or pregnant women (n = 3). High-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was the primary analytical platform to measure both PFAS and metabolome. PFAS were measured in either plasma (n = 6) or serum (n = 5), while metabolomic profiles were assessed using plasma (n = 6), serum (n = 4), or urine (n = 1). Four types of PFAS (perfluorooctane sulfonate (n = 11), perfluorooctanoic acid (n = 10), perfluorohexane sulfonate (n = 9), perfluorononanoic acid (n = 5)) and PFAS mixtures (n = 7) were the most studied. We found that alterations to tryptophan metabolism and the urea cycle were most reported PFAS-associated metabolomic signatures. Numerous lipid metabolites were also suggested to be associated with PFAS exposure, especially key metabolites in glycerophospholipid metabolism which is critical for biological membrane functions, and fatty acids and carnitines which are relevant to the energy supply pathway of fatty acid oxidation. Other important metabolome changes reported included the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle regarding energy generation, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism in cellular energy systems. Conclusions: There is growing interest in using non-targeted metabolomics to study the human physiological changes associated with PFAS exposure. Multiple PFAS were reported to be associated with alterations in amino acid and lipid metabolism, but these results are driven by one predominant type of pathway analysis thus require further confirmation. Standardizing research methods and reporting are recommended to facilitate result comparison. Future studies should consider potential differences in study methodology, use of prospective design, and influence from confounding bias and measurement errors.

The regulatory effects and molecular mechanisms of L-carnitine on fat and protein metabolism in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were investigated in this study. Common carp (n = 270) were randomly divided into three groups and fed either (1) common carp diet, (2) high-fat/low-protein diet, or (3) L-carnitine-high-fat/low-protein diet. Growth performance, plasma biochemistry, muscle composition, and ammonia excretion rate were all examined after 8 weeks. Additionally, each group's hepatopancreas was subjected to transcriptome analysis. The results showed that decreasing the feed protein/fat ratio resulted in a considerable increase in feed conversion ratio and a significant decrease in common carp-specific growth rate to 1.19 +/- 0.02 eth P < 0.05 THORN . Similarly, total plasma cholesterol sharply increased to 10.15 +/- 2.07, while plasma urea nitrogen, muscle protein, and ammonia excretion levels dropped (P < 0.05). After adding L-carnitine to the high-fat/low-protein diet, it was found that the specific growth rate and protein content of the dorsal muscle increased significantly (P < 0.05). In contrast, the plasma total cholesterol and ammonia excretion rate decreased considerably at most time points after feeding (P < 0.05). The expression of genes in the hepatopancreas differed substantially between the different groups. Through GO analysis, it was demonstrated that L-carnitine increased the ability of fat decomposition by up-regulating the expression of cpt1 in the hepatopancreas and decreased the expression of fasn and elovl6 to reduce the production and extension of lipids. Simultaneously, mtor was more abundant in the hepatopancreas, implying that L-carnitine can increase protein synthesis. According to the findings, adding L-carnitine to high-fat/low-protein diets can stimulate growth by enhancing lipolysis and protein synthesis.

J	Xu, ZW; Zhao, HB; Wei, YJ; Zheng, CG				Xu, Zuwei; Zhao, Haibo; Wei, Yijie; Zheng, Chuguang			Self-assembly template combustion synthesis of a core-shell CuO@TiO2-Al2O3 hierarchical structure as an oxygen carrier for the chemical-looping processes	COMBUSTION AND FLAME												Chemical looping combustion (CLC) and chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) are the most promising technologies for capture of CO2 at a low cost. CLC and CLOU involve cyclic reduction and oxidation of a solid oxygen carrier (OC) to transfer active oxygen from air to carbon-based fuels for combustion with the inherent feature of isolating CO2. One key issue with these technologies is to manufacture a high-performance, economical and practical OC material. In this paper, we propose a self-assembly template combustion synthesis (SATCS) method for preparing a hierarchical structure copper-based OC, Cu-rich, Al2O3-supported and TiO2-stabilized in a core-shell microarchitecture. The selection of raw materials and the rational design of OCs are based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, respectively. The spontaneous aggregation between alpha-Al2O3 microparticles (mu m-Al2O3) and rutile TiO2 nanoparticles (nm-TiO2) is driven by the van der Waals attractive and electrostatic attractive forces to form core(Al2O3)-shell(TiO2) hard templates in the wet precursor containing copper nitrate and urea. Upon calcination of the dried precursor in air, fewer nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released, demonstrating an environment-friendly fabrication process, whereby a highly dispersed and high-loading Cu-based crystalline layer is deposited on the nanostructured shell. A representative CuO@TiO2-Al2O3 OC (17.5 wt% Al2O3, 5 wt% TiO2) possesses hierarchical porosity and an interconnected framework and exhibits excellent performance of the reactivity, stability, oxygen release/uptake capacity and mechanical strength in the high-temperature redox cycles. The proper addition of TiO2 nanoparticles is effective in preventing the formation of copper aluminates (CuAl2O4 and CuAlO2) and inhibiting the sintering of active component grain. In addition, the rational design method and novel synthesis technique allow a mass production of various metal oxide composites used for chemical looping processes with CO2 capture and clean utilization of energy.

Pistia stratiotes has renoprotective potentials in ischemia reperfusion injury in normal and diabetic rats	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY												OBJECTIVE: Even though oxidative and inflammatory bursts are a big part of renal reperfusion injury (RI/R), Pistia stratiotes (PS) has been used for a long time to stop these overreactions. People have said that it can drop both blood sugar and cholesterol. Hence, the goal of this study was to show how PS changed kidney reperfusion damage in both diabetic and normal rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the study, 30 min of renal ischemia (RI) was followed by 1 h of recovery for each rat. Before the test, PS (100 mg/kg p. o.) was given to the animals for 7 days. Then, using the mixture from the separated kidney tissues, the antioxidant, inflammation, and histopathological effects were determined. RESULTS: When compared to RI/R, diabetic rats given PS had lower blood sugar, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, myeloperoxidase, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in their urine. CONCLUSION: PS potentially worked in hyperglycemic rats protecting them against RI/R. It is possible that PS's ability to protect the kidneys of the test rats is due to its ability to fight free radicals, lower blood sugar, and stop inflammation.

Dietary Amino Acid Deficiency Reduces the Utilization of Amino Acids for Growth in Growing Pigs after a Period of Poor Health	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION												Background: During immune system activation, partitioning of amino acids (AAs) changes between protein gain and use by the immune system. Objective: We determined the effects of health status and dietary AA deficiency on nitrogen retention and AA utilization in pigs. Methods: Barrows (55 d of age) were obtained from good health (GH, n = 14) or poor health (PH, n = 14) status farms and allocated to a diet either adequate in essential amino acids (Adq) or 25% deficient in Met + Cys, Thr, and Trp (Def). Nitrogen balance was measured and AA irreversible loss rates (I LRs) were measured after an intravenous bolus of U-C-13 labeled L-AAs. Results: On arrival at the experimental facilities, the PH pigs had 14% lower serum albumin and 50% greater serum haptoglobin and blood leukocyte counts than the GH pigs (P< 0.01), but the PH pigs showed signs of recovery during the trial. Total tract nitrogen digestibility was 3 percentage points lower in the PH pigs (P < 0.01). The PH-Adq pigs had compensatory body weight gain after arrival, coinciding with 7% greater nitrogen retention (P < 0.01) in the PH pigs than in the GH pigs. The PH pigs had a 24% greater ILF1 for Lys. Health status x diet interactions for Lys (P= 0.07), Val (P= 0.03), and Leu (P= 0.10) pool sizes and a greater urea pool size in the PH pigs (P= 0.01) support the observation that the increase in the ILR of Lys in the PH pigs was related to oxidation when feeding the Def diet, but to synthesis when feeding the Adq diet. Feeding Def diets increased monocyte counts by 30% (P < 0.01). Conclusions: This study illustrates how the competition for AAs between protein synthesis associated with immune system activation and body protein deposition is greater when the dietary supply of Met + Cys, Thr, and Trp is limited in pigs during and after a period of poor health.																			0022-3166	1541-6100				JAN	2016	146	1					51	58		10.3945/jn.115.216044	http://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.115.216044								26609170					WOS:000367701100008

It is, however, unclear how such conditions then impact net soil N-release and availability to the rice crop, because we do not know well enough how water-saving irrigation management shapes depth-distribution of Eh and reductive processes, and microbial activity. A field experiment with rice was laid out on a typical young floodplain paddy soil of Bangladesh with three irrigation schemes, viz. continuous flooding (CF), safe alternate wetting and drying (AWD) and direct seeded rice (DSR), with 120 kg N ha(-1) (N-120) or without (N-0) urea application. We evaluated changes in soil mineral N and plant N uptake, CH4 and CO2 emissions and soil pH, and at multiple depths soil Eh and temperature, dissolved C, Fe and Mn throughout 2015 dry (Boro) season (Jan-Apr). Eh stayed at or above similar to + 300 mV except for sudden drops to similar to -200 mV with irrigation events in DSR. Eh quickly dropped to methanogenic conditions, under both AWD and CF; rises to similar to + 200 mV were observed during AWD-drainage events but were restricted to upper 5.5 or 12.5 cm depths. Throughout the growing season there was a pronounced increase in reductive dissolution of Fe and Mn (hydro-) oxides, buildup of dissolved C, and CH4 effluxes under AWD and CF but not DSR, likely at least partially driven by the gradual soil warming from similar to 20 degrees C till 28 degrees C. Predominant aerobic conditions under DSR lead to a nearly doubled C-emissions (CO2 + CH4) compared to AWD and CF, suggesting more soil organic matter (OM) degradation in the former case, while soil mineral N plus plant N build-up rate followed an opposite order. Urea application did not raise soil exchangeable N levels, even prior to significant plant uptake from 28 DAT (days after transplanting), and we forward temporal abiotic NH4+-fixation and N-removal processes as explanations. We conclude that regardless of some distinctions in temporal evolutions of puddle layer Eh, solution C, Fe and Mn, and CH4-emission, soil N-supply was quite comparable under AWD and CF, as was rice yield. In the context of N availability, AWD could be safely adopted for rice growth in the Bangladeshi Boro season. The eventual fertilizer N recovery efficiency was higher for CF (42%) than for AWD (32%), but AWD saved 12% irrigation water. While DSR saved 45% water there was a large yield penalty, likely due to drought stress but also by poor germination caused by cold night temperatures in mid-January, while seedling transplantation in CF and AWD plots was only later on 28 January. Further research should be conducted to investigate the fast and pronounced removal of exchangeable inorganic N after initial N buildup by soil OM mineralization, especially in CF and AWD. At this moment most likely candidate processes appear clay-NH4+ fixation and anaerobic NH4+-oxidation.					Deroo, Heleen/HTP-7917-2023; Kader, Md.

The optimal HTNBC degraded a 0.1 mM aqueous solution of bisphenol A (BPA) within 10 min at a rate of 0.62 min-1, exhibiting a significantly superior catalytic activity compared to that of pristine sludge biochar. The HTNBC/PMS system effectively oxidized various organic pollutants, including BPA, sulfamethoxazole, 4-chlorophenol, carbamazepine, and nitrobenzene with a low consumption of PMS (1.0 mM) and a low catalyst loading (0.2 g/L). The active sites for PMS activation were identified as graphitic-N, pyridinic-N, and carbonyl groups, besides structural defects and a high specific surface area were also important. The primary oxidation mechanism was anticipated to involve non-radical pathways followed by radical-induced oxidation, in which the surface-bound reactions dominate. The HTNBC/PMS system acts over a wide pH range and exhibits a high resistance to the inorganic anions of natural water. Our results indicate that nitrogen doping via a hydrothermal route allows the fabrication of biochar with a greater abundance of oxygen functional groups, and the specific nitrogen species present within the carbon matrix are also of importance in the development of advanced carbon catalysts.

Effects of heat stress during porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection on metabolic responses in growing pigs	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												Heat stress (HS) and immune challenges negatively impact nutrient allocation and metabolism in swine, especially due to elevated heat load. In order to assess the effects of HS during Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) infection on metabolism, 9-wk old crossbred barrows were individually housed, fed ad libitum, divided into four treatments: thermo-neutral (TN), thermo-neutral PRRSV infected (TP), HS, and HS PRRSV infected (HP), and subjected to two experimental phases. Phase 1 occurred in TN conditions (22 degrees C) where half the animals were infected with PRRS virus (n = 12), while the other half (n = 11) remained uninfected. Phase 2 began, after 10 d with half of the uninfected (n = 6) and infected groups (n = 6) transported to heated rooms (35 degrees C) for 3 d of continuous heat, while the rest remained in TN conditions. Blood samples were collected prior to each phase and at trial completion before sacrifice. PPRS viral load indicated only infected animals were infected. Individual rectal temperature (Tr), respiration rates (RR), and feed intakes (FT) were determined daily. Pigs exposed to either challenge had an increased T-r, (P < 0.0001) whereas RR increased (P < 0.0001) with HS, compared to TN. ADG and BW decreased with challenges compared to TN, with the greatest loss to HP pigs. Markers of muscle degradation such as creatine kinase, creatinine, and urea nitrogen were elevated during challenges. Blood glucose levels tended to decrease in HS pigs. HS tended to decrease white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocytes and increase monocytes and eosinophils during HS. However, neutrophils were significantly increased (P < 0.01) during HP. Metabolic flexibility tended to decrease in PRRS infected pigs as well as HS pigs. Fatty acid oxidation measured by CO2 production decreased in HP pigs. Taken together, these data demonstrate the additive effects of the HP challenge compared to either PRRSV or HS alone.

Abraham			Systematic Study on Morphological, Electrochemical Impedance, and Electrocatalytic Activity of Graphitic Carbon Nitride Modified on a Glassy Carbon Substrate from Sequential Exfoliation in Water	LANGMUIR												Several researchers have synthesized graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) from various precursors and attached it to electrode substrates after exfoliation under different conditions and have reported inconsistent data on electrochemical impedance, electroactive surface areas, and electrocatalytic activity. Thus, the present study aims to study the same systematically in addition to morphology after modifying GCN on the GC substrate from different exfoliation times in water assisted by sonication. The GCN was prepared from urea by bulk condensation pyrolysis and then attached to the GC substrate by drop casting to study its morphology, electrochemical impedance, and electrocatalytic activity with respect to exfoliation. The SEM image of a GCN-modified GC plate after 15 and 30 min of exfoliation shows bulky structure whereas thin sheets of GCN were noticed after 120 min of exfoliation. On the other hand, broken sheets were observed when GCN was coated from beyond 120 min of exfoliation. The electrochemical impedance studies show that the charge transfer resistance (R-C(T)) of GCN modified from 15 and 30 min of exfoliation was higher than that for the bare GC electrode. However, it started to decrease while increasing the exfoliation time, and 1.8 k Omega was obtained after 120 min of exfoliation. The R-CT value was again increased to 3.2 and 5.0 k Omega for GCN coated after 150 and 180 min of exfoliation, respectively. The electroactive surface area (EASA) of GCN modified by 15 and 30 min of exfoliation was less than that of the bare GC electrode, whereas it was 3.8-fold higher for GCN coated from 120 min of exfoliation. The electrocatalytic activity of the GC electrodes modified with GCN was then tested by studying ascorbic acid (AA) and dopamine (DA) oxidation and reduction of hydrogen peroxide (HP). Among the different exfoliation times, GCN modified from 120 min of exfoliation displayed the highest electrocatalytic activity toward AA, DA, and HP. This was attributed to its higher EASA and lower charge-transfer resistance.

Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, caused by acute kidney damage, causes histopathological alterations, tubule cell apoptosis, inflammation, oxidation, and the loss of renal function. We evaluated the protective effects against I/R injury of beluga lentil pretreatment. Materials and Methods. Mice were divided into four groups: normal, untreated, low- (2 mg), and high-dose (8 mg) beluga lentil treatment groups. Beluga lentil was orally administered for 2 weeks, followed by bilateral renal ischemia for 20 min and reperfusion for 30 min. Blood samples and kidney tissues were collected and analyzed to investigate renal function, histopathology, epithelial and endothelial cell damage, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses. Results. The pretreated groups maintained renal function, with significantly lower blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, compared with the other groups. The histopathological analysis showed reduced proximal tubule injury and decreased injury-related molecule (kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)) secretion in the pretreated groups compared with the other groups. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling- (TUNEL-) positive cells and the secretion of apoptosis-related molecules (Fas and caspase 3) were significantly reduced in the pretreated groups compared with the other groups. The pretreated groups showed positive microvessel-associated gene (cluster of differentiation (CD31)) expression and negative adhesion molecule (intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)) expression. An antioxidant effect was observed in the pretreatment groups, with reduced malonaldehyde (MDA) expression and increased antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)) secretion. In the pretreated groups, F4/80+ macrophages and CD4+ T cell infiltration were inhibited and proinflammatory cytokine (interleukin- (IL-) 1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) alpha) levels decreased; however, the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (transforming growth factor- (TGF-) beta, IL-10, and IL-22) increased. Conclusions. Beluga lentil pretreatment demonstrated protective effects against I/R-induced renal damage, via antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities.

Metabolomics allows the discrimination of the pathophysiological relevance of hyperinsulinism in obese prepubertal children	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY												BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Insulin resistance (IR) is the cornerstone of the obesity-associated metabolic derangements observed in obese children. Targeted metabolomics was employed to explore the pathophysiological relevance of hyperinsulinemia in childhood obesity in order to identify biomarkers of IR with potential clinical application. SUBJECTS/METHODS: One hundred prepubertal obese children (50 girls/50 boys, 50% IR and 50% non-IR in each group), underwent an oral glucose tolerance test for usual carbohydrate and lipid metabolism determinations. Fasting serum leptin, total and high molecular weight-adiponectin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured and the metabolites showing significant differences between IR and non-IR groups in a previous metabolomics study were quantified. Enrichment of metabolic pathways (quantitative enrichment analysis) and the correlations between lipid and carbohydrate metabolism parameters, adipokines and serum metabolites were investigated, with their discriminatory capacity being evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-three metabolite sets were enriched in the serum metabolome of IR obese children (P < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) < 5%). The urea cycle, alanine metabolism and glucose-alanine cycle were the most significantly enriched pathways (P-FDR < 0.00005). The high correlation between metabolites related to fatty acid oxidation and amino acids (mainly branched chain and aromatic amino acids) pointed to the possible contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction in IR. The degree of body mass index-standard deviation score (BMI-SDS) excess did not correlate with any of the metabolomic components studied. In the ROC analysis, the combination of leptin and alanine showed a high IR discrimination value in the whole cohort (area under curve, AUC(ALL) = 0.87), as well as in boys (AUC(M) = 0.84) and girls (AUC(F) = 0.91) when considered separately. However, the specific metabolite/adipokine combinations with highest sensitivity were different between the sexes. CONCLUSIONS: Combined sets of metabolic, adipokine and metabolomic parameters can identify pathophysiological relevant IR in a single fasting sample, suggesting a potential application of metabolomic analysis in clinical practice to better identify children at risk without using invasive protocols.

Nematodes synthesize metabolites for organismal development and social communication. We performed metabolic profiling of H. schachtii and H. trifolii in the egg, juvenile 2 (J2), and female stages. In all, 392 peaks were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry, which revealed a lot of similarities among metabolomes. Aromatic amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, choline metabolism, methionine salvage pathway, glutamate metabolism, urea cycle, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, coenzyme metabolism, purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for energy conversion (beta-oxidation and branched-chain amino acid metabolism) energy storage were involved in all stages studied. The egg and female stages synthesized higher levels of metabolites compared to the J2 stage. The key metabolites detected were glycerol, guanosine, hydroxyproline, citric acid, phosphorylcholine, and the essential amino acids Phe, Leu, Ser, and Val. Metabolites, such as hydroxyproline, acetylcholine, serotonin, glutathione, and glutathione disulfide, which are associated with growth and reproduction, mobility, and neurotransmission, predominated in the J2 stage. Other metabolites, such as SAM, 3PSer, 3-ureidopropionic acid, CTP, UDP, UTP, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid, 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol, 2-hydroxy-4-methylvaleric acid, Gly Asp, glucuronic acid-3 + galacturonic acid-3 Ser-Glu, citrulline, and gamma-Glu-Asn, were highly detected in the egg stage. Meanwhile, nicotinamide, 3-PG, F6P, Cys, ADP-Ribose, Ru5P, S7P, IMP, DAP, diethanolamine, p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, and gamma-Glu-Arg_divalent were unique to the J2 stage. Formiminoglutamic acid, nicotinaminde riboside + XC0089, putrescine, thiamine 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 3-methyladenine, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, m-hydrobenzoic acid, o- and p-coumaric acid, and shikimic acid were specific to the female stage. Overall, highly similar identities and quantities of metabolites between the corresponding stages of the two species of nematode were observed. Our results will be a valuable resource for further studies of physiological changes related to the development of nematodes and nematode-plant interactions.

Low selenium intake leads to increased cardiovascular mortality. Intervention with these substances with healthy elderly persons over a period of four years in a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled prospective study showed reduced cardiovascular mortality, increased cardiac function, and a lower level of NT-proBNP. Therefore, we wanted to evaluate changes in biochemical pathways as a result of the intervention with SeQ(10) using metabolic profiling. From a population of 443 healthy elderly individuals that were given 200 mu g selenium and 200 mg coenzyme Q(10), or placebo daily for four years, we selected nine males on active intervention and nine males on placebo for metabolic profiling in the main study. To confirm the results, two validation studies (study 1 n = 60 males, study 2 n = 37 males) were conducted. Principal component analyses were used on clinical and demographic data to select representative sets of samples for analysis and to divide the samples into batches for analysis. Gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based metabolomics was applied. The metabolite data were evaluated using univariate and multivariate approaches, mainly T-tests and orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS) analyses. Out of 95 identified metabolites, 19 were significantly decreased due to the intervention after 18 months of intervention. Significant changes could be seen in the pentose phosphate, the mevalonate, the beta-oxidation and the xanthine oxidase pathways. The intervention also resulted in changes in the urea cycle, and increases in the levels of the precursors to neurotransmitters of the brain. This adds information to previous published results reporting decreased oxidative stress and inflammation. This is the first-time metabolic profiling has been applied to elucidate the mechanisms behind an intervention with SeQ(10). The study is small and should be regarded as hypothesis-generating; however, the results are interesting and, therefore, further research in the area is needed.

Training promotes healthy metabolic and oxidative profiles whereas the effects of multi-day, prolonged, and continuous exercise are unknown. This study investigated the effects of multi-day prolonged exercise on metabolic and oxidative stress as well as telomere integrity in healthy adults. Methods: Fifteen participants performed a 14-day, 260-km, wilderness canoeing expedition (12 males) (EXP) (24 +/- 7 years, 72 +/- 6 kg, 178 +/- 8.0 cm, 18.4 +/- 8.4% BF, 47.5 +/- 9.3 mlO(2) kg(-1) min(-1)), requiring 6-9 h of low- to moderate-intensity exercise daily. Ten controls participated locally (seven males) (CON) (31 +/- 11 years, 72 +/- 15 kg, 174 +/- 10 cm, 22.8 +/- 10.0% BF, 47.1 +/- 9.0 mlO(2) kg(-1) min(-1)). Blood plasma, serum, and mononuclear cells were sampled before and after the expedition to assess hormonal, metabolic, and oxidative changes. Results: Serum cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein, testosterone, insulin, sodium, potassium, urea, and chloride concentrations were not different between groups, whereas triglycerides, glucose, and creatinine levels were lower following the expedition (p < 0.001). Malondialdehyde and relative telomere length (TL) were unaffected (EXP: 4.2 +/- 1.3 vs. CON: 4.1 +/- 0.7 mu M; p > 0.05; EXP: 1.00 +/- 0.48 vs. CON: 0.89 +/- 0.28 TS ratio; p = 0.77, respectively); however, superoxidase dismutase activity was greater in the expedition group (3.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 0.8 +/- 0.5 U ml(-1); p < 0.001). Conclusion: These results indicate a modest improvement in metabolic and oxidative profiles with increased superoxidase dismutase levels, suggesting an antioxidative response to counteract the exercise-associated production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species during prolonged exercise, mimicking the effects from long-term training. Although improved antioxidant activity may lead to increased TL, the present exercise stimulus was insufficient to promote a positive cellular aging profile with concordant chromosomal changes in our healthy and young participants.

Electroanalytical and spectral investigation of organic receptors as colorimetric and absorption ratiometric anion chemosensor	SUPRAMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY												Colorimetric receptors R1 and R2 have been designed and synthesized by Schiff base condensation and characterised by standard spectroscopic techniques. Anion binding ability of the receptors have been investigated quantitatively through optical, electrochemical and (HNMR)-H-1 titration studies. UV-vis spectra of receptor R1 and R2 exhibited a significant red shift for F- and AcO- ions with a visual color response. Receptor R1 exhibited selective response towards AcO- ion in the presence of HEPES buffer media. Incremental color change of receptor R2 with the higher equivalence of AcO- ions clearly represent the ratiometric response. Cyclic voltammetric studies of R1 and R2 exhibits shift in oxidation and reduction peak with successive addition of AcO- ions indicating the anion induced oxidation of -NH and reduction of the keto group and nitro species. Electrooptical and H-1 NMR titration studies of R2 collectively reflects the anion induced change of chromophore from C=N to N=N indicative of azo-hydrazone tautomeric signaling in the presence of AcO- ions. Lower detection limit of 2.1 and 0.41ppm achieved with sodium salt of AcO- ion with R1 and R2 reflects their utility as colorimetric chemosensor.

After phosphorylation, no significant decrease in the pulp recovery ratio was observed, and the viscosity-average degree of polymerization of phosphorylated pulp was almost equal to that of the original pulp. In addition, the crystal structure and crystallinity index were almost unchanged during phosphorylation. The obtained phosphorylated CNF dispersion was highly transparent, and the maximum total light transmittance was nearly 100% when the CNF content was 0.2 wt%. The maximum viscosity of the CNF dispersions was nearly 10-100 times greater than that of conventional thickeners. Furthermore, we found that not only insufficient but also excessive phosphorylation negatively affected the gravimetric yield, transparency and viscosity.																			0969-0239	1572-882X				MAR	2017	24	3					1295	1305		10.1007/s10570-017-1191-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-017-1191-3													WOS:000395067400009

A full Euro VI emission control system was used and the accumulation of catalyst poisons from the combustion was investigated for the up-stream particulate filter as well as the SCR catalyst. The NO(x)reduction performance in terms of standard, fast and NO2-rich SCR was evaluated before and after exposure to exhaust from a biogas-powered engine for 900 h. The SCR catalyst retains a significant part of its activity towards NO(x)reduction after exposure to biogas exhaust, likely due to capture of catalyst poisons on the up-stream components where the deactivation of the oxidation catalyst is especially profound. At lower temperatures some deactivation of the first part of the SCR catalyst was observed which could be explained by a considerably higher surface V4+/V(5+)ratio for this sample compared to the other samples. The higher value indicates that the reoxidation of V(4+)to V(5+)is partially hindered, blocking the redox cycle for parts of the active sites.

The TOCFs were first dissolved in a NaOH/urea solvent and transformed into microspheres via an emulsification method. The carboxyl groups on the surface of TOCFs were successfully carried on the cellulose-based microspheres, which provides them numerous reacting or binding sites, allowing them to be easily functionalized or immobilized with biomolecules for multi-functional applications. Furthermore, the introduction of magnetic nanoparticles awards these microspheres magnetic properties, allowing them to be attracted by a magnetic field. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the application of using these carboxylate cellulose-based microspheres for enzyme immobilization. The cellulose-based microspheres can successfully create stable covalent bonds with enzymes after the activation of carboxyl groups. The enhanced pH tolerance, thermal stability, convenient recovery, and reusability position the emulsified microspheres as promising carriers for enzyme immobilization.					wang, jiahui/IXD-1197-2023														0141-8130	1879-0003				FEB 28	2022	199						61	68		10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.12.069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.12.069		JAN 2022						34954297					WOS:000849654200008

Imaging and catalytic performance results suggest that the dual-enzyme nanoflower greatly reduces the diffusion and decomposition of H2O2 and facilitates the mass transfer of glucose oxidase/lipase. Furthermore, the controllable generation of H2O2 and peracid contributes to the good stability of the dual-enzyme nanoflower, which exhibits a higher catalytic performance than the free enzymes in a dual-enzymatic cascade epoxidation. The yield of epoxidation was up to 82% even after ten cycles, further indicating the good reusability of the dual-enzyme nanoflower and its great potential for application in other enzymatic oxidations.

However, the low current density caused by the competition of the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode has hindered the large-scale production of fine chemicals and H-2. Besides, the separation of products from the complicated electrolyte also remains a significant barrier. Herein, we present the integration of hybrid water electrolysis and conventional crystallization separation for the first time, achieving the electrocatalytic production and separation of benzoic acid without impurities. An amorphous nanosheet composed of Ni, Co hydroxide supported on Ni foam (A-Ni-Co-H/NF), with a large active area and low charge transfer resistance, is prepared for the first time and applied to catalyze the electrocatalytic benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction. A-Ni-Co-H/NF enables us to achieve an industrial-scale current density over 400 mA cm(-2) without the occurrence of the OER, and delivers ultrafast reaction kinetics. The yield of Ph-COOH is close to 100%, only spending 15 min at room temperature and atmosphere pressure. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the as-made A-Ni-Co-H/NF catalyst features reversible structure evolution and recovery during the EBA reaction. The converted nickel oxyhydroxide containing Co species (Co-NiOOH) is confirmed as the real active species. This presents a novel electrocatalyst to achieve industrial-scale prodution for value-added chemicals and the novel integrated technology also provides guidance for the separation and collection of products during the electrocatalytic process.

Synthesis of 3,5-Disubstituted Isoxazoles and Isoxazolines in Deep Eutectic Solvents	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING												The synthesis of different 3,5-disubstituted isoxazoles and related isoxazolines using choline chloride:urea as deep eutectic solvent (DES) in a one-pot three step reaction has been accomplished successfully. The use of highly nucleophilic functionalized DES did not affect the process where highly electrophilic reagents or intermediates are involved. The presence of DES showed to be essential since the reaction in absence of this media did not proceed. The DES media could be reused up to five times without a detrimental effect on the yield of the reaction. To exemplify the synthetic potential of this methodology, the reaction was scaled up to the gram scale without any noticeable problem. Finally, different isoxazoles were easily transformed into beta-aminoenones.

In this article, ultrafine palladium nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen-doping carbon support ( Pd/N-XC72R) were fabricated, wherein the N-XC72R was prepared through low-temperature annealing of Vulcan XC72R carbon with urea at 300 degrees C. Nitrogen dopant on the surface of carbon support can remarkably strengthen the affinity of the metal nanoparticles onto the support. Compared with the Vulcan XC-72R-supported Pd catalyst, the prepared Pd/N-XC72R delivered superior catalytic activity for the transfer hydrogenation of nitroarenes with formic acid as the hydrogen donor at ambient temperature.

Furthermore, to explore the potential of nano-nickel aluminate, we used synthesized nanomaterials as a heterogeneous catalyst for the acetylation of alcohols, phenols and amines.

Urea-derived carbon nitride (UCN) was verified to be most efficient in fungicide removal. The influences of catalyst dosage and pH were studied during the photodegradation process. Hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) and holes (h(+)) are the active species during photodegradation of each of the eight fungicides within an aqueous environment. The primary photodegradation products and pathways of all eight fungicides were systematically identified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.

AQPs provide for a huge variety of physiological phenomena; their alteration provokes several types of pathologies including cancer and hematological malignancies. Our review presents data revealing the possibility of employing aquaporins as biomarkers in patients with hematological malignancies and evaluates the possibility that interfering with the expression of aquaporins could represent an effective treatment for hematological malignancies. Aquaporins are transmembrane molecules regulating the transfer of water and other compounds such as ions, glycerol, urea, and hydrogen peroxide. Their alteration has been reported in several conditions such as cancer. Tumor progression might be enhanced by aquaporins in modifying tumor angiogenesis, cell volume adaptation, proteases activity, cell-matrix adhesions, actin cytoskeleton, epithelial-mesenchymal transitions, and acting on several signaling pathways facilitating cancer progression. Close connections have also been identified between the aquaporins and hematological malignancies. However, it is difficult to identify a unique action exerted by aquaporins in different hemopathies, and each aquaporin has specific effects that vary according to the class of aquaporin examined and to the different neoplastic cells. However, the expression of aquaporins is altered in cell cultures and in patients with acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, in lymphoproliferative diseases and in multiple myeloma, and the different expression of aquaporins seems to be able to influence the efficacy of treatment and could have a prognostic significance, as greater expression of aquaporins is correlated to improved overall survival in leukemia patients. Finally, we assessed the possibility that modifying the aquaporin expression using aquaporin-targeting regulators, specific monoclonal antibodies, and even aquaporin gene transfer could represent an effective therapy of hematological malignancies.

Herein, we report a novel heterogeneous catalyst by immobilizing poly triazine-thiourea-sulfonamide (PTTSA) on the surface of the Zn-Al-Cu core. In this sense, the sulfonated catalyst was obtained via simple sulfonation using chlorosulfonic acid (Zn-Al-Cu@PTTSA-SO3H). The post-synthetically modified nanomaterial was characterized using FT-IR, FE-SEM, TGA, EDX, XRD, and WDX. Regarding the catalytic exploration, we aimed at synthesizing furano and pyrano pyrimidinone derivatives via a one-pot three-component reaction of urea/thiourea, 2,3-dihydrofuran/3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran, and aldehydes with a variety of substrates. The catalyst is highly reusable and efficient, especially in terms of time and yield of the desired product.					alavinia, sedigheh/GMW-9777-2022														2365-6549					FEB 24	2022	7	8							e202103856	10.1002/slct.202103856	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/slct.202103856													WOS:000760360800014

Although concepts enabling their reprocessing have been demonstrated, their practical potential is limited by the deteriorated performance of the reprocessed materials. Here, we report a thiourea based thermoset elastomer that can be reprocessed with enhanced mechanical properties. We reveal that the thiourea bonds are dynamic which leads to the reprocessibility. More importantly, they can undergo selective oxidation during high temperature reprocessing, resulting in significant chemical strengthening within certain reprocessing cycles. This is opposite to most polymers for which reprocessing typically results in material deterioration. The possibility of having materials with inherent reprocessing induced performance enhancement points to a promising direction towards polymer recycling. The ability to reprocess thermoset polymers has been demonstrated in principle, but is not widely done due to deteriorated performance of the reprocessed materials. Here, we report a thiourea-based thermoset elastomer that can be reprocessed with enhanced mechanical properties.

In recent years, an increasing number of studies have examined the removal of DBP. In this study we use a composite material of N-Ti/13X/MCM-41, synthesized by nitrogen, molecular sieve 13X, tetrabutyl orthotitanate and tetraethyl orthosilicate as raw materials, CTAB as a structural template and tetrabutyl titanate and urea under hydrothermal conditions. The optimized experimental conditions, such as the amount of material, reaction time, pH value and initial concentration were tested. The surface areas of N-Ti/13X/MCM-41 were found to be 664 m(2)g(-1). TEM micrographs revealed N-Ti/13X/MCM-41 is consisting of aggregates of spherical particles, similar with standard synthesized MCM-41 (Mobil Composition of Matter No. 41).

This operation formulates very interesting, ecological perspective due to simple reaction condition, isolation and purification of products. In addition, this methodology offers a competitive recyclability of the catalyst without a significant loss of its catalytic activity and could be readily reused, thus making this protocol more environmentally acceptable whilst no catalyst leaching was observed.					karthikeyan, parasuraman/ABF-2281-2020	PARASURAMAN, KARTHIKEYAN/0000-0002-9870-9741													1870-249X	1665-9686					2018	62	3					29	38		10.29356/jmcs.v62i3.779	http://dx.doi.org/10.29356/jmcs.v62i3.779													WOS:000496746700004

The mixtures were cast on glass plates, soaked in an acid solution, and the regenerated gel-like films were washed with water and then dried. The TOCN did not form agglomerates in the composites, and had the structure of TOCN-COOH, forming hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of the regenerated cellulose molecules. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the matrix cellulose molecules increased the cellulose II crystal size upon incorporation of TOCN. As a result, the TOCN/AUC composite films had high Young's modulus, tensile strength, thermal stability and oxygen-barrier properties. The TOCN/AUC composite films are promising all-cellulose nanocomposites for versatile applications as new bio-based materials.

Sulfation degrees in the case of reactions with sulfuric acid, sodium sulfite, sulfamic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and sodium laurilsulfate range from 14.7 to 36.9 mg sulfo per gram waste. The C-O-S formation gives rise to accessional noncrystallinity and mesoporosity of morphology, a character for potential alternatives in catalysis. Waste sulfates are employed as candidates in catalyzing the condensation of alpha-glycolic acid and urea substitutes for yielding imidazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives. Catalytic and specific activities in terms of derivative productions are 2.6-34.3 (x10(3) U) and 0.8-5.4 U/mg sulfo, together with the maximal yields of 49.4%-97.6%. Chemical linkage of sulfo/sulfoalkyl groups manifests synergism with intrinsic acidity of waste with respect to catalysis. A rational design of green chemistry is guaranteed by no excess of chemicals and easy recyclability of catalysts.

The results show that with the thermal treatment time increases from 2 h to 12 h, the shape of as-prepared Co3O4 microcrystals changes from the hedgehog spherelike to the as-cubic one that were stacked by lots of lamella, and finally cubes, and then longer time treatment will only lead to the size growth and agglomeration of particles.

Accordingly, Zn-Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) were grown in the presence of functionalized CNTs during urea hydrolysis. The presence of CNTs led to the formation of LDH nanoplatelets, and TEM images showed that the CNTs were coated with nanoplatelets. The nanoplatelets were thermally treated to form nanocomposite-coated CNTs. Raman spectra demonstrated the successful coating of CNTs with LDHs and nanocomposite. The coated CNTs were very effective in the photocatalytic degradation of industrial pollutants.

In this regard, four types of urea-based electrolytes with various amounts of NH4NO3 were employed. The effect of electrolyte composition on the characteristics of the formed layer was studied using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy.

To investigate the corrosion resistance of the coated samples, the potentiodynamic polarization test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were performed in Ringer's solution. It was observed that as the NH4NO3 concentration of electrolyte increased, the corrosion resistance of the formed layer was reduced. Such a behaviour was attributed to the operating current as well as discharge energy enhancement which caused the deep cracks and porosities formation in the coating.

The photocatalytic activity was evaluated in the degradation of ethylbenzene in the gas phase at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. The results showed that nitrogen and fluorine were successfully doped in TiO2 leading to a clear narrowing of the band gap energy (red shift). This narrowing was especially observed for N-TiO2 (2.91 eV) when using urea as nitrogen precursor. The sample prepared with 4-fluorobenzyleamine as precursor showed the smallest pore size (around 10 nm) and crystallite size (about 12 nm) compared to the other prepared catalysts.

The nitrogen functionalization of NSC catalysts significantly affected the chemical micro-environments as well as microstructures (morphology and porosity), improving the PMS activation activity towards removing various pollutants, e.g., acid orange 7, phenol and rhodamine B. On the basis of quenching studies and electron paramagnetic resonance, the formed dominant reactive oxidative species (ROS) in the NSC/PMS system was clarified to be nonradical singlet oxygen, in addition to the typical radical ROSs, sulfate and hydroxyl radicals. The incorporated pyridine N, graphite N and pristine C=O in the NSC framework promoted the generation of ROS. This study provided new insights into environmentally friendly resourcing SS and exploiting novel cost-effective metal-free catalyst for PMS activation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we report a facile method for preparation of nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) using urea as a nitrogen precursor. The prepared metal-free N-rGO is able to efficiently activate persulfate (PS) to produce reactive radicals for degradation of an antibiotic of sulfachloropyridazine (SCP). The effects of reaction parameters on SCP degradation were investigated. The activation processes were studied by in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), which discovered the newly observed hydroxyl radicals from PS activation. This study suggests a green remediation for removal of antibiotics in wastewater without producing any heavy metal leaching as the secondary contamination. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Synthesis and characterization of AgCl@graphitic carbon nitride hybrid materials for the photocatalytic degradation of atrazine	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL												Mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (pg-C3N4) was prepared via pyrolysis of dicyandiamide and urea in an air atmosphere. AgCl@pg-C3N4 nanocomposites were synthesized using a modified precipitation technique. pg-C3N4 and AgCl@pg-C3N4 nanocomposites were characterized using XRD, BET, UV-Vis spectroscopy, PL, TEM, and XPS techniques. The results reveal that AgCl was well dispersed on the surface of the pg-C3N4. The photocatalytic degradation of atrazine under visible light irradiation was used to measure the photocatalytic performance of the pg-C3N4 and AgCl@pg-C3N4 nanocomposites. The photocatalytic activity of the AgCl@pg-C3N4 nanocomposite has higher photocatalytic activity than the pg-C3N4 nanoparticles. The reason for the high photocatalytic activity of the AgCl@pg-C3N4 nanocomposite may be due to the synergic effect between AgCl and pg-C3N4. The photocatalytic degradation of atrazine follows a first order reaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

Herein, carbon nitride homojunction with open tubular interior, porosity and interconnected feature has been developed via one-step pyrolyzing urea and L-cysteine. The experimental results and DFT calculations indicate that such unique tubular S-scheme homojunctions not only apparently boost in-plane exciton dissolution and suppress the inversive charge recombination via built-in electric field, but also decrease Gibbs free energy of intermediate hydrogen absorption. Thus, the tubular carbon nitride homojunctions display an excellent hydrogen production (4548.4 ?mol/g/h), which is 35-fold improvement than that of pristine carbon nitride, outperforming the most reported donor-acceptor-based carbon nitride homojunctions and tubular carbon nitride. This work provides useful guidance to rational fabrication of S-scheme carbon nitride homojunction with positive exciton splitting and interfacial charge transfer for energy and environmental applications.					lan, xuefang/GZK-3433-2022; Jiang, Wenjun/N-1571-2019; Wang, Guangzhao/C-7962-2018; Ma, Yongchao/AAD-7872-2019; Jiang, Wenjun/H-3889-2015	lan, xuefang/0000-0001-9860-1450; Jiang, Wenjun/0000-0002-3195-6166													1385-8947	1873-3212				JUN 15	2021	414								128802	10.1016/j.cej.2021.128802	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.128802		FEB 2021											WOS:000641348600006

Differentiating Organically Farmed Rice from Conventional and Green Rice Harvested from an Experimental Field Trial Using Stable Isotopes and Multi-Element Chemometrics	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												Chemometric methods using stable isotopes and elemental fingerprinting were used to characterize organically grown rice from green and conventionally grown rice in experimental field trials in China. Carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen stable isotopes as well as 26 other elements were determined. Organic rice was found to be more depleted in C-13 than green or conventionally grown rice because of the uptake of enriched C-13 from carbon dioxide and methane respiring bacteria and more enriched in N-15 because of the volatilization of the nitrogen from the urea and ammonium of the animal manures used to manufacture the organic composts. Chemometrics (principal-component analysis and linear-discriminant analysis) were used to separate the three farming methods and provided a promising scientific tool to authenticate the farming methods of different rice cultivars fertilized with animal manures, green composts, and synthetic fertilizers in China or elsewhere.

J	Yetim, NK				Yetim, Nurdan Kurnaz			Hydrothermal synthesis of Co3O4 with different morphology: Investigation of magnetic and electrochemical properties	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE												Co3O4 nanostructures were manufactured using hydrothermal synthesis method and then at high temperature calcinations process was performed. In the production process, the starting material remained constant and the additives were changed where urea (CO(NH2)(2)), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), ethylenediamine (C2H4(NH2)(2)) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were used. As a result, different type of nanostructures were obtained (nanosheets, nanosphere, the poppy flowers like structures, clover field-like structures). The crystal properties and chemical composition of the products was confirmed by XRD (X-ray diffraction) technique and FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared) spectroscopy. The surface morphology of the Co3O4 nanostructures was assessed using SEM (scanning electron microscopy). The electrochemical activity of the Co3O4 nanostructures were examined by CV (cyclic voltammetry). CV curves indicate that the charge mechanisms of all samples show pseudocapacitive behaviours. Magnetic characterization of the Co3O4 nanostructures was investigated by vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) measurements at room temperature. It was concluded that production parameters like temperature and stabilizer used in the production affect the physical and magnetic properties of Co3O4 nanostructures. Vibrating sample magnetometry results showed poor ferromagnetic and typical antiferromagnetic behaviours where typical hysteresis curve was not observed for most of the samples. Such a case attributable to shape and size of the Co3O4 nanostructures.(C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methanol, a cheap and readily available resource from chemical industry, could be activated by transition metal catalysts. This review focuses in covering the recent five-years literature and provides a systematic summary of strategies for methanol activation and the use in organic chemistry. Based on these strategies, many new synthetic methods have been developed for methanol utilization as the C1 building block in methylation, hydromethylation, aminomethylation, formylation reactions, as well as the syntheses of urea derivatives and heterocycles.

The aim of this study was to identify the low-molecular weight compounds contributing to the metabolomic profile of psoriasis and to provide computational models that help with the classification and monitoring of the severity of the disease. We compared the results from targeted and untargeted analyses of patients' serums with plaque psoriasis to controls. The main differences were found in the concentrations of acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines, amino acids, urea, phytol, and 1,11-undecanedicarboxylic acid. The data from the targeted analysis were used to build classification models for psoriasis.

The DPA- and iminodiacetate-imidazoloporphyrin conjugates were structurally characterized. The chemosensing potential of the metal chelate-imidazoloporphyrin conjugates was evaluated, though their constrained metric parameters led to muted chemosensing responses to various divalent metal ions. The accessibility of the meso-arylporpholactams and the meso-tetraphenylimidazoloporphyrin triflate enables the continued exploration of porphyrin-like pyrrole-modified porphyrins that incorporate a nitrogen atom in place of a beta-carbon atom in their macrocycles.					; Bruckner, Christian/C-4644-2018	Hamchand, Randy/0000-0002-9078-7550; Bruckner, Christian/0000-0002-1560-7345													0022-3263					SEP 7	2018	83	17					9619	9630		10.1021/acs.joc.8b00790	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.8b00790								30058335					WOS:000444364600005

The electrode material is a keyfactor for improving the performance of ZABs. Here, a facile strategyfor the fabrication of N-rich porous carbon is reported. H3BTC and GO are selected as carbon precursors, histidine and Fe(NO3)(3) are used as ligands, and urea is used as a Nsource and template. After the conventional drying of the complexand following carbonization process, serial N-doped carbon materialsare prepared. The composition and structure of the material are characterized,and the effect of the ligand is studied. The hierarchical porous structurefacilitates the full exposition of N and trace of Fe active sitesand benefits the transportation of electrolytes, thus improving theoxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The ORR performances show that theporous carbon has a positive initial and half-wave potential, goodlimiting current density, a near four-electron transfer process, andbetter methanol resistance and durability. The assembled ZAB exhibitshigh specific capacity (880.4 mAh g(Zn) (-1)), excellent open-circuit voltage (1.54 V), and superior cyclingstability, which further provides the significant potential for itsapplication.																			0743-7463	1520-5827				MAY 31	2023	39	23					8065	8074		10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c00347	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c00347		MAY 2023						37255434					WOS:001011130600001

Nitrogen-doping on this material leads to a high specific surface area of 761 m(2) g(-1) and uniform pores with a diameter of 9 nm. Electrochemical tests show that the N-doped OMCS possesses high catalytic activities on the oxygen reduction reaction, which can be attributed to the pyridinic-type and pyrrolic-type nitrogen activating nearby carbon atoms. In addition, we demonstrate that the unique physical structure and surface chemical properties of OMCS improve the dispersion and structure of supported metal Ru nanoparticles, which lead to enhance oxygen evolution reaction activity.

Reactive removal of 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide vapors under visible light irradiation by cerium oxide modified highly porous zirconium (hydr) oxide	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE												Highly porous cerium oxide modified Zr(OH)(4) samples were synthesized using a simple one stage urea precipitation method. The amorphicity level of zirconium hydroxide did not change upon addition of cerium oxide particles. A unique aspect of the cerium oxide-modified materials is the presence of both the oxide (CeO2) and hydroxide (Zr(OH)(4)) phases resulting in a unique microporous structure of the final material. Extensive characterization using various chemical and physical methods revealed significant differences in the surface features. All synthesized materials were microporous and small additions of cerium oxide affected the surface chemistry. These samples were found as effective catalysts for a decontamination of mustard gas surrogate, 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES). Cerium oxide addition significantly decreased the band gap of zirconium hydroxide. Ethyl vinyl sulfide and 1,2-bis (Ethyl thio) ethane were identified as surface reaction products.

In this study, we employed the urea combustion method to load CoFe2O4 particles onto activated carbon (CFO-AC-500). Subsequently, the catalyst was incorporated into a column continuous flow device, testing the effects of multi water parameters and toxicity, and predicting the degradation process on the catalytic degradation of OI for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. In CFO-AC-500/PMS continuous reactor, it showed a satisfied OI removal of more than 82 % of the OI at a flow rate of 73.6 mL/min in 240 min. Also, response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize the operating conditions, with model fitting results demonstrating that the OI removal rate could reach 95.07 % under specific conditions. ESR analyses revealed that the degradation of OI was primarily governed by free radicals (SO4 center dot-, HO center dot and O2 center dot-) and non-radical pathways (1O2). The biological toxicity of degraded OI was significantly reduced. This innovative CFO-AC-500/PMS continuous flow system can provide an effective new method for the degradation of difficult-to-treat pollutants in practical applications.

Herein, we report that hybrid water electrolysis, integrating the electrochemical reforming of benzyl alcohol (BA) and the H-2 evolution reaction (HER), largely accelerates the kinetics and stability of H-2 production over a hierarchical bifunctional catalyst couple of Mo-Ni alloy nanoparticles in 1.0 M KOH. The high-performance of the hierarchical Mo-Ni nanoparticle catalyst for both the HER and the BA oxidation not only eliminated the need for an ion-conducting membrane to separate the cathodic and anodic reactions to achieve nearly unity faradaic efficiences for the two reactions, but also allowed the reactions to be readily driven by low cell voltage in a two-electrode configuration. Specifically, the cell voltages required to deliver the benchmark current densities of 20, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2) are as low as 1.40, 1.45, and 1.53 V, respectively. The membrane-free hybrid water electrolysis technology exhibits a set of advantages including long device lifetime, ease of H-2 collection, and high efficiency, thus showing significant promise for practical H-2 production, especially considering the fact that the device can be readily powered by a single-cell alkaline battery or a solar cell under natural sunlight irradiation.

A New Generation of Surface Active Carbon Textiles As Reactive Adsorbents of Indoor Formaldehyde	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES												Highly porous carbon textiles were modified by impregnation with urea, thiourea, dicyandiamide, or penicillin G, followed by heat treatment at 800 degrees C. This resulted in an incorporation of nitrogen or nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms in various configurations to the carbon surface. The volume of pores and, especially, ultramicropores was also affected to various extents. The modified textiles were then used as adsorbents of formaldehyde (1 ppmv) in dynamic conditions. The modifications applied significantly improved the adsorptive performance. For the majority of samples, formaldehyde adsorption resulted in a decrease in the volume of ultramicropores. The enhancement in the adsorption was linked not only to the physical adsorption of formaldehyde in small pores but also to its reactivity with sulfonic groups and amines present on the surface. Water on the surface and in challenge gas decreased the adsorptive performance owing to the competition with formaldehyde for polar centers. The results collected show that the S- and N-modified textiles can work as efficient media for indoor formaldehyde removal.

The exact mechanisms of disease progression are unclear, with limited work done using metabolite profiling to study disease progression.ObjectiveThe aim of this pilot study was to profile the plasma metabolomics in an animal model of Y. pestis infection.MethodsIn this study, African Green monkeys were challenged with the highly virulent, aerosolized Y. pestis strain CO92, and untargeted metabolomics profiling of plasma was performed using liquid and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry.ResultsAt early time points post-exposure, we found significant increases in polyunsaturated, long chain fatty acid metabolites with p values ranging from as low as 0.000001 (ratio=1.94) for the metabolite eicosapentaenoate to 0.04 (ratio=1.36) for the metabolite adrenate when compared to time-matched controls. Multiple acyl carnitines metabolites were increased at earlier time points and could be a result of fatty acid oxidation defects with p values ranging from as low as 0.00001 (ratio=2.95) for the metabolite octanoylcarnitine to 0.04 (ratio=1.33) for metabolite deoxycarnitine when compared to time-matched controls. Dicarboxylic acids are important metabolic products of fatty acids oxidation, and when compared to time matched controls, were higher at earlier time points where metabolite tetradecanedioate has a ratio of 4.09 with significant p value of 0.000002 and adipate with a ratio of 1.12 and p value of 0.004. The metabolites from lysolipids (with significant p values ranging from 0.00006 for 1-oleoylglycerophosphoethanolamine to 0.04 for 1-stearoylglycerophosphoethanolamine and a ratio of 0.47 and 0.78, respectively) and bile acid metabolism (with significant p values ranging from 0.02 for cholate to 0.04 for deoxycholate and a ratio of 0.39 and 0.66, respectively) pathways were significantly lower compared to their time-matched controls during the entire course of infection. Metabolite levels from amino acid pathways were disrupted, and a few from the leucine, isoleucine and valine pathway were significantly higher (p values ranging from 0.002 to 0.04 and ratios ranging from 1.3 to 1.5, respectively), whereas metabolites from the urea cycle, arginine and proline pathways were significantly lower (p values ranging from 0.00008 to 0.02 and ratios ranging from 0.5 to 0.7, respectively) during the course of infection.ConclusionsThe involvement of several lipid pathways post-infection suggested activation of pathways linked to inflammation and oxidative stress. Metabolite data further showed increased energy demand, and multiple metabolites indicated potential hepatic dysfunction. Integration of blood metabolomics and transcriptomics data identified linoleate as a core metabolite with cross-talk with multiple genes from various time points. Collectively, the data from this study provided new insights into the mechanisms of Y. pestis pathogenesis that may aid in development of therapeutics.

J	Kim, C; Ha, Y; Choi, M				Kim, Chaehoon; Ha, Yejee; Choi, Minkee			Design of Amine-Containing Nanoporous Materials for Postcombustion CO2 Capture from Engineering Perspectives	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH												Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) is a means to enable the continued use of fossil fuels in the short term. In particular, postcombustion CO2 capture has attracted considerable attention because it can be retrofitted into existing power plants and industrial plants. Among various CO2 capture technologies, the absorption of CO2 using aqueous amines has been industrially employed for decades. However, such amine scrubbing technologies have inherent limitations of environmental and health concerns due to volatile amine loss, corrosion, and high energy demands for regeneration. To overcome these limitations, CO2 adsorption using solid adsorbents has emerged as a promising alternative due to its noncorrosiveness and low energy demand. Various amine-containing adsorbents have been synthesized and investigated for postcombustion CO2 capture. These materials are prepared by physically impregnating low-vapor-pressure amine polymers or by chemically grafting amines onto nanoporous materials. A wide variety of amine guests and nanoporous hosts (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3, zeolites, MOFs, and polymers) have been combined to develop advanced CO2 adsorbents.The design of CO2 adsorbents is a multifaceted puzzle that must ultimately consider integration with large-scale CO2 capture processes. Various engineering aspects need to be carefully considered. Unfortunately, a significant proportion of previous studies has primarily focused on the use of novel materials for improving the CO2 adsorption capacity. In this Account, we describe key challenges and solutions to develop energy-efficient and stable amine-containing adsorbents for postcombustion CO2 capture via temperature swing adsorption (TSA). We found that a high CO2 working capacity, often overemphasized in the literature, does not necessarily guarantee a low energy demand for CO2 capture. Suppressing coadsorption of H2O during the CO2 adsorption in humid flue gas is also a significant factor. Amine-containing adsorbents can be degraded through various pathways, including hydrothermal degradation of nanoporous hosts and chemical degradation of amine guests via urea formation and oxidation. To inhibit such degradation pathways, it is extremely important to properly design the nanoporous structures of the hosts and the molecular structures of the amine guests. By combining macroporous silica hosts, poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) functionalized with various alkyl epoxides, and phosphate-based oxidative stabilizers, we could synthesize adsorbents exhibiting low energy demands for CO2 capture and unprecedentedly high thermochemical stability under TSA conditions. The macroporous silica host synthesized by assembling fumed silica particles via spray-drying exhibited high hydrothermal stability and enabled uniform distribution of bulky amine polymers within its pores. The functionalization of PEI with alkyl epoxides converted its primary amines into hindered secondary amines, leading to a significant reduction in energy demand for TSA cycles and a remarkable improvement in long-term stabilities. The oxidative stability of amines could be drastically improved by adding phosphate metal-binding reagents, which can poison ppm-level metal impurities that catalyze amine oxidation. The present discussions will provide important insights into designing practical adsorbents for CO2 capture from engineering perspectives.

In this work, a comparative study of g-C3N4 made from urea, melamine, thiourea, and dicyandiamide respectively under the same thermal process condition was carried out to distinguish their photocatalytic activities. By determining the yield of H2O2 produced under the same light conditions, the ability of the above four g-C3N4 photocatalysts was compared and the amount of H2O2 produced within 5 h was 55.8, 112.7, 101, and 134 mu mol/L respectively. Photoelectrochemical and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements indicated that g-C3N4 photocatalysts made from melamine and dicyandiamide with higher H2O2 production had higher photocurrent and lower charge transfer impedance. This might relate to the differences in material crystallinity and the band gap, which influenced their effective carrier concentration.

Advantages of nitrogen fertilizer deep placement in greenhouse gas emissions and net ecosystem economic benefits from no-tillage paddy fields	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Unreasonable application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers gives rise to agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, causing increases in carbon footprint (CF). To solve such problems, scholars have proposed the practice of N deep placement (DPN), which has been proven to be an effective approach to enhance N use efficiency and reduce N loss. However, the effect of DPN on CF and net ecosystem economic benefit (NEEB) from no-tillage (NT) rice fields remains largely unknown. In this work, a field experiment was conducted with a random complete block design to investigate the differences in soil CH4 and N2O emissions, agricultural GHG emissions, grain yield, CF, and NEEB from NT paddy fields between urea deep placement (UDP) and urea broadcasting (UBC) in central China. The CF for the entire rice production chain can be calculated as the ratio of total GHG emissions to grain yield using a life-cycle approach. The novelty of this study lies in the examination of the integrated effects of DPN on GHG emissions, grain yield, CF and NEEB from NT paddy fields. The agricultural GHG emissions varied from 1297.0 to 1420.8 kg CO2-eq ha(-1). Chemical fertilizers dominated the GHG emissions. UDP resulted in 96.8 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) more emissions than UBC due to more consumption of diesel by machinery operations. Compared with UBC, UDP significantly reduced soil CH4 emissions by 36-39% and N2O emissions by 29-31%. The mitigation of soil CH4 and N2O emissions under UDP decreased the total GHG emissions by 34% and CF by 46%. Soil CH4 emissions accounted for 83-88% of the total GHG emissions. The NEEB under UDP was 48% higher than that under UBC. In conclusion, DPN can increase grain yield, reduce CF, and enhance NEEB from NT rice fields, and may be an economic and cleaner approach for rice production. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

To address the low catalytic performance of non-precious metal catalysts, one of the approaches is to introduce a second metal. In this work, a series of Cu-Ni bimetallic catalysts derived from Ca-Al hydrotalcite-like compounds were prepared by the urea hydrolysis method combined with hydrothermal treatment, featuring well-dispersion with a size of 3-5 nm. The electron redistribution triggered by the incorporation of Cu enhances the absorption of methanol at the electron poor surface, leading to maintained catalytic activity at 450 & DEG;C for 96 hours with few carbon-deposition observed for methanol autothermal reforming.

Extracellular enzymes have not been represented in global biogeochemical models. Understanding the relationships among EEA and SOC, soil N (TN), and soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) under N fertilization would enable modeling of the influence of EEA on SOC decomposition. Based on 65 published studies, we synthesized the activities of alpha-1,4-glucosidase (AG), beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG), beta-D-cellobiosidase (CBH), beta-1,4-xylosidase (BX), beta-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG), leucine amino peptidase (LAP), urease (UREA), acid phosphatase (AP), phenol oxidase (PHO), and peroxidase (PEO) in response to N fertilization. The proxy variables for hydrolytic C acquisition enzymes (C-acq), N acquisition (N-acq), and oxidative decomposition (OX) were calculated as the sum of AG, BG, CBH and BX; AG and LAP; PHO and PEO, respectively. The relationships between response ratios (RRs) of EEA and SOC, TN, or. MBC were explored when they were reported simultaneously. Results showed that N fertilization significantly increased CBH, C-acq, AP, BX, BG, AG, and UREA activities by 6.4, 9.1, 10.6, 11.0, 11.2, 12.0, and 18.6%, but decreased PEO, OX and PHO by 6.1, 7.9 and 11.1%, respectively. N fertilization enhanced SOC and TN by 7.6% and 15.3%, respectively, but inhibited MBC by 9.5%. Significant positive correlations were found only between the RRs of C-acq and MBC, suggesting that changes in combined hydrolase activities might act as a proxy for MBC under N fertilization. In contrast with other variables, the RRs of AP, MBC, and TN showed unidirectional trends under different edaphic, environmental, and physiological conditions. Our results provide the first comprehensive set of evidence of how hydrolase and oxidase activities respond to N fertilization in various ecosystems. Future large-scale model projections could incorporate the observed relationship between hydrolases and microbial biomass as a proxy for C acquisition under global N enrichment scenarios in different ecosystems.

Deep eutectic solvents (DES) are characterized by a wide electrochemical window, allowing the electrodeposition of metallic elements having a highly negative reduction potential. Electrodeposition of unconventional metals with reduction potential well below hydrogen evolution one is, in principle, feasible (e.g. Sm). Moreover, the limited presence of water during the growth of SmCo alloys may reduce oxidation and consequently improve the magnetic properties with respect to the employment of an aqueous bath. Deposits composition is strongly affected by process parameters and bath composition. Increasing choline chloride concentration and/or adding glycine to the solution allows to achieve higher Sm content in the deposit. Potentiostatic electrodeposition has been carried out in a conventional three electrodes cell, with potential interval selected from -0.7 V vs Ag wire to -0.95 V vs Ag wire, keeping the bath under stirring at 70 degrees C. Magnetic SmCo films with composition from 0 to 50 wt% Sm have been obtained with coercivity up to 270 Oe. (c) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS. All rights reserved.

Yttrium-doped NiO-ZrOm catalyst resulted in higher interaction between Ni and ZrOm, higher distribution of weak and medium basic sites, and smaller Ni crystallite size, as compared to the Y-free NiO-ZrOm catalyst after reaction. The DRM catalytic tests were conducted at 700 degrees C for 8 h, leading to a significant decrease of activity and selectivity for the yttrium-doped NiO-ZrOm catalyst. The carbon deposition after the DRM reaction on yttrium-doped NiO-ZrOm catalyst was lower than on yttrium-free NiO-ZrOm catalyst, which indicated that yttrium could promote the inhibition of carbon deposition during the DRM process.

Recently, a study demonstrated that curcumin ointment reduced pain, mammary tension and erythema in humans with mastitis 72 h after the treatment. Mastitis in sheep is an important problem due to restrictions associated to the use of antibiotics, affecting milk production and becoming a public health issue. Thus, the aim of this study was to verify whether the addition of curcumin in the diet of six female sheep with subclinical mastitis could have curative efficacy and benefits to animal health. Cases: Six Lacaune sheep with subclinical mastitis that persisted for more than thirty days after the parturition were used. The animals received feed containing the curcumin (60 mg/animal/day) during 10 days. On days 0 and 10 of the experiment, total blood was collected to perform the hemogram and serum biochemistry (triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, total protein (TP), albumin, globulin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and urea), as well as individual milk samples for centesimal composition, somatic cell count (SCC) and total bacterial count (TBC). Total leukocytes and erythrocytes, as well as hemoglobin content, were obtained using the hematological counter CELM-CC-550. Blood smears were stained by the Romanowsky method and used for leukocytes differentiation. After ten days of treatment, five sheep were negative in the California Mastitis Test (CMT). Total erythrocytes increased, while total leukocytes decreased after the treatment. Seric levels of AST, triglycerides, cholesterol and globulins decreased, while seric levels of albumin and urea increased after ten days of treatment. No differences were observed regarding milk production and composition, as well as for SCC and TBC on days 0 and 10 post-treatment. Discussion: The use curcumin to prevent or to delay the occurrence of subclinical mastitis in ewes was first tested. In an experiment of lipopolysaccharide-induced mastitis in rats, researchers identified receptors type Toll 4 which are related with the induction of the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6 and 1 , molecules involved in the migration of leukocytes to the site of inflammation. According to literature, curcumin was able to reduce the activity of myeloperoxidase in the mammary gland, an enzyme used as indicator of neutrophil infiltration, demonstrating the potent anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin. This effect can be associated to the release of interleukin-8, a cytokine that promotes the migration of neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils into the site of infection, i.e., the mammary gland. It is important to highlight that neutrophils, due to its capacity to release inflammatory mediators and to delay apoptosis, has the potential to maintain a permanent inflammatory process, effects that were prevented or reduced by curcumin, specially the apoptotic and cytotoxic effects. It is important to emphasize the direct effect of curcumin on bacteria present in the mammary gland, since it exerts potent bactericidal effect. In summary, the use of curcumin in sheep with subclinical mastitis exerted beneficial effects in the dose of 60 mg/sheep/day, since it showed 83.3% of curative efficacy in the test CMT. This effect of curcumin can be direct or indirect, since the curcumin provided in the diet showed anti-inflammatory properties by reducing oxidation reactions and cell damage. Overall, the addition of curcumin in sheep diet improved the hematological and biochemical variables after only ten days of treatment. Future studies should be performed to clarify and determine whether the curcumin provided in diet can be an alternative to treat clinical or subclinical mastitis.

One of the major drawbacksis the tightly coupled kinetically sluggish and energy inefficientanodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with hydrogen forming a cathodichalf-cell reaction which leads to a significant reduction in overallcell efficiency. In this context, before reviewing the literature,we have first briefly analyzed the energetics of overall water splitting,problems, and challenges under different pH conditions which can beuseful for the further understanding of the process. Replacement ofthe anodic OER by a thermodynamically favorable substrate oxidationoffers flexibility, value addition, and energy efficiency in the caseof hybrid or assisted water electrolysis to afford hydrogen. Recentprogress in terms of sacrificial oxidants in hybrid water electrolysisare discussed in this context, where the sacrificial oxidants areso chosen that the oxidation often leads to its value addition. Alsohere, we have offered insights into interface designing in heterostructuresby modulating chemical and electronic environments for the enhancementof the intrinsic catalytic activity and stability. The effect of incorporationof such materials into the overall water splitting reaction, theircatalytic active sites, and interactions with intermediates are thoroughlyexplored. This review can be a good complement for better understandingof the elucidation of the interface role in hybrid water electrolysisfor future commercial applications.

This work has been focused on the controlled synthesis and characterization of cationic- and amphiphilic-templated ceria, zirconia, and ceria-zirconia mixed oxides from nitrate and iso-propoxide precursors, and ceria-zirconia mixed oxides modified with gold via the deposition precipitation method with urea. The characterization of the acidic and basic properties was carried out through two test reactions. A complete chemical and structural characterization of the materials was done using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS), Brunauer-Emmet-Teller Surface Analysis (N-2-BET), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), NH3- Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD)/CO2-TPD, and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Template techniques led to the formation of high surface area mesoporous materials with high activity and thermal stability. In general, the acid sites density was decreased, whereas the basic site density was increased by modification with Au or incorporation of zirconia in case of mixed oxides.

The hydrophobicity of mutations targeting D1:Val219 modifies formate and diuron binding in the quinone-Fe-acceptor complex of Photosystem II	PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM												The D1:Val219 residue of Photosystem II in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was mutated to alanine or isoleucine, creating the V219A and V219I mutants, respectively. Oxygen evolution was slowed in these mutants, while chlorophyll a fluorescence induction assays indicated slowed electron transfer. As previously observed [Erickson J.M., Rahire, M., Rochaix, J.-D. and Mets. L. (1985) Science, 228, 204-207], the V219I mutant was resistant to 3,4-dichloro-1,1-dimethyl urea (DCMU); however, the V219A strain displayed no DCMU resistance. Additionally, the V219A strain was less sensitive to the addition of formate than the control, while the V219I strain was more sensitive to formate. Both mutant strains were susceptible to photodamage and required protein synthesis for recovery. We hypothesize that the sensitivity to DCMU and the extent of bicarbonate-reversible formate-induced inhibition, as well as the capacity for recovery in cells following photodamage, are influenced by the hydrophobicity of the environment associated with the Val219 residue in D1.

We describe the living cationic ring-opening polymerization of a 2-alkylthio-2-oxazoline to furnish a polythiocarbamate. The polythiocarbamate is activated toward substitution by N- and S-nucleophiles via oxidation of the S to an SO2. Mild substitution conditions provide broad functional group tolerance, constituting a versatile postpolymerization modification platform with access to a diversity of polyureas and polythiocarbamates. We further demonstrate the utility of this strategy by synthesizing and functionalizing block copolymers.

N-Doped graphene is synthesized by using urea and graphene oxide as nitrogen source and precursor, respectively. XRD, Raman spectra, XPS, SEM and HRTEM are utilized to characterize the structure of the synthesized N-doped graphenes. XPS reveals that the doped nitrogens on the surface exist in three forms of nitrogen atom: pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic. Moreover, it shows that the contents of the three states of doped N obtained from various nitrogen doped contents are different. Dehydrogenation results show that the N-doped graphene efficiently catalyzes the dehydrogenation of ethanol, and acetaldehyde is obtained as the only product without any byproduct in all the cases. In addition, the nitrogen-doped content and reaction temperature obviously have significant effects on the catalytic performance of NG. The dehydrogenation mechanism for ethanol under the catalysis of NG has also been proposed.

The efficiency of the resulted acid/base bifunctional catalyst (gamma-Fe2O3@Cu3Al-LDH/HEPES) was investigated in Biginelli-like synthesis of biologically active pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines via the cyclocondensation of 3-methyl, 1-phenyl-H1-pyrazole-5-ol with various aromatic aldehydes and urea derivatives in a mixture of water and ethanol (1:1) under reflux conditions. Besides, the desired products were reached with high conversions and powerful reusability. Utilization of simple and mild reaction conditions, hybrid bifunctional catalytic groups, short reaction time, green and safe solvent, high catalytic performance and good recyclability, easy purification of the products, and simple magnetically work-up make this methodology an interesting and effective option in the Biginelli reaction.

Herein, we reported a modified molten-salts method to fabricate the crystalline carbon nitride under ambient pressure, which is expected to the large-scale production of crystalline carbon nitride. The obtained crystalline carbon nitride displayed about 3.0 times higher photocatalytic NO removal performance than that of pristine carbon nitride under visible light irradiation (lambda < 400 nm). Detailed experimental characterization and theoretical calculation revealed the crucial roles of crystallinity in crystalline carbon nitride for the enhanced photocatalytic NO removal performance.

The aim of this study was evaluating the effect Humic acids on the chili pepper (Capsicum annuum) and eggplant (Solanum melongena) plants growing in soils fertilized with urea. 200 g of soil were incorporated to the fertilizer once and the Humic acid in concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2%. All measurements growths were carried out during 45 days growth. The finding shows that all treatments cause significant increases (p < 0.05) in the total area of roots. For the chili pepper, the multiple comparison tests of Tukey and Dunnett showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the control soils and the soils containing 0.1% and 0.2% of Humic acid. By the opposite, no statistical differences (p > 0.05) were observed among control soil and those containing 0.05 % of Humic acid. Concerning the eggplant, significant differences were established (p <0.05) between the control and samples incorporated with 0.1% and 0.2% of Humic acid. The Humic acids act as a growth biostimulant in chili pepper plants (Capsicum annuum) and eggplant (Solanum melongena).																			2079-052X	2079-0538				NOV	2018	30	11					941	945		10.9755/ejfa.2018.v30.i11.1845	http://dx.doi.org/10.9755/ejfa.2018.v30.i11.1845													WOS:000458211900005

The as-prepared CoO@Co-NC/KB displays higher electrocatalytic activity, smaller Tafel slope and better durability for the oxygen evolution reaction than those of the benchmark commercial RuO2 catalyst in 1.0 M KOH solution, far outperforming the control groups (i.e. CoO@Co-g-C3N4/KB, Co-NC/KB, CoO-NC/KB, CoO@Co/KB, CoO@Co-NC and Co3O4-NC/KB). The remarkable electrocatalytic performance of CoO@Co-NC/KB is primarily credited to the synergistic effect between Co and CoO species with a core-shell structure, increased active sites and considerably enhanced electronic conductivity.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of roasted duck's edible and nutritional quality after VPS through serum biochemical indicators and in vivo digestion properties in rats. The results show that roasted duck after VPS led to an increase in the total protein content (57.24 g/L) and blood glucose levels (6.87 mmol/L), as well as a decrease in the blood urea nitrogen content (11.81 mmol/L), in rats. Compared to rats fed base diets and roasted duck after static wet salting (SWS), those ingesting roasted duck after VPS exhibited higher values of apparent protein digestibility (51.24%), pepsin activity (2.40 U/mg), and trypsin activity (389.80 U/mg). Furthermore, VPS treatment improved the textural properties and microstructure of duck breasts shown by a higher immobilized water relaxation area and more ordered protein structures (alpha-helixes and beta-sheets). These improvements enhanced the protein anabolism capacity and in vivo digestion properties in rats. Therefore, VPS represents a beneficial salting method for promoting effective digestion and absorption in rats.

Moreover, the construction of a heterojunction at the interface of two semiconductor photocatalysts with suitable band positions plays a crucial role in separating and transporting charge carriers.

This S-scheme hetero- junction photocatalyst shows high activity toward photocatalytic H2O2 production, which is 3.4 and 5.0 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4 and ZnO, respectively.

In ChCl/glycerol (1 : 2 mol mol-1) and ChCl/urea (1 : 2 mol mol-1), these reactions yield up to 97 % under aerobic conditions at ambient temperature within 2-12 h. The practicality of the method is exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of an FFA4 agonist and a key building block en route to anti-Alzheimer drug BMS-299897. A subtle interplay of electronic effects and the solubility characteristics of the starting materials in the aforementioned DESs seem to be responsible for driving the reaction successfully over the hydrolysis of sulfonyl chlorides. The procedure's eco-friendliness is validated by quantitative metrics like the E-factor and the EcoScale, with products isolated by extraction or filtration after decantation. A sustainable and scalable synthesis of sulfonamides, from amines and sulfonyl chlorides, is achieved under aerobic conditions, at ambient temperature, in reusable choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvents. The interplay of electronic effects and the solubility characteristics of the starting materials in the selected DESs drives the sulfonamide synthesis over the hydrolysis of sulfonyl chlorides. image					Perna, Filippo/I-4336-2019; Capriati, Vito/M-5595-2017; vitale, paola/A-3370-2014	Pulpito, Mara/0000-0001-7521-8723; Capriati, Vito/0000-0003-4883-7128; Perna, Filippo M./0000-0002-8735-8165; vitale, paola/0000-0001-8132-2893													0947-6539	1521-3765				OCT 1	2024	30	55							e202402293	10.1002/chem.202402293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/chem.202402293								39037002					WOS:001327935200021

Subsequently, Cu2O-NH2-SBA-15 hybrid was used as a modifier of glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for making a non-enzymatic glucose sensor. The optimum composition of the modifier on the GCE surface (0.47 mg Cu in Cu2O-NH2-SBA-15/cm(2) surface area of GCE) resulted in a wide linearity range (0.2-15 mM glucose) and a high sensitivity of 438.3 mu Acm(-2) mM(-1), due to the high loading of Cu2O in NH2-SBA-15 host. Furthermore, glucose was detected both in normal range (5 mM) and in hypoglycaemic range (2 mM), selectively in presence of concentrations of interfering species typically found in the normal blood, such as sodium chloride (142 mM), potassium chloride (3.7 mM), urea (4.7 mM) and ascorbic acid (0.05 mM). The response time was also less than 5 s. Therefore, it achieved the desirable sensor characteristics, like linearity, sensitivity, selectivity, and speed of response. This better performance of the sensor is mainly attributed to a high electrocatalytic activity of Cu2O nanoparticles towards glucose.																			1380-2224	1573-4854				AUG	2021	28	4					1097	1104		10.1007/s10934-021-01064-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10934-021-01064-6		MAR 2021											WOS:000630250700001
J	Raza, H; Woo, S; Kim, H				Raza, Hassan; Woo, Sanghee; Kim, Hongsuk			Investigation of an ammonium carbamate-based SCR system for NOx reduction in diesel engines under transient conditions	ENERGY												The deNOx performance of a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system using ammonium carbamate (AC) was investigated and compared with that of a urea water solution (UWS). The effects of the NH3/NOx (a) ratio, injection threshold temperature (T-inj), and a zero-dimensional ammonia adsorption-desorption model on NOx conversion efficiency were evaluated. World harmonized transient cycle (WHTC) and non-road transient cycle (NRTC) tests were conducted using a 3.9-L diesel engine over a Cu-zeolite catalyst. The NOx conversion efficiency of AC in the WHTC and NRTC was increased compared with that of UWS during the cold phase by 6.43% and 8.71%, respectively, and during the hot phase by 14.79% and 11.93%, respectively. Gaseous ammonia injection at a low Tinj can explain improved deNOx performance, as increasing Tinj leads to a decrease in NOx conversion efficiency. Increasing the a ratio effectively increases NOx conversion efficiency, but a high a ratio leads to ammonia slip. Ammonia injection using a model-based control increased cold-start deNOx performance. These promising results provide an alternative pathway to controlling NOx emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These two scraps comprise the only constituents of Mn-Zn ferrite. The as-synthesized Mn-Zn ferrite was then suspended in a solution containing Ti(SO4)(2) and urea. Subsequently a magnetic photocatalyst was obtained from the solution by chemical coprecipitation. The prepared Mn-Zn ferrite powder and magnetic photocatalyst (Mn-Zn ferrite/TiO2) were characterized using XRD, EDX, SEM, SQUID, BET, and so forth. The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized magnetic photocatalysts was tested using degradation of FBL dye wastewater. The adsorption and degradation studies by the TOC and ADMI measurement were carried out, respectively. The adsorption isotherm and Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model for the prepared magnetic TiO2 were proved to be applicable for the treatment. This research transforms waste into a valuable magnetic photocatalyst.																			1687-4110	1687-4129					2015	2015								651021	10.1155/2015/651021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/651021													WOS:000354369200001
J	Lang, C; Sécordel, X; Courson, C				Lang, Charlotte; Secordel, Xavier; Courson, Claire			Copper-Based Water Gas Shift Catalysts for Hydrogen Rich Syngas Production from Biomass Steam Gasification	ENERGY & FUELS												Copper-based catalysts deposited on foams were developed to perform the water gas shift reaction at low temperature (150-300 degrees C) at the outlet of a biomass gasifier with limited pressure drop. Different synthesis methods were used such as wet impregnation and urea-nitrates combustion methods for the preparation of copper/ceria/foam catalysts containing 4.5-7.0 wt % of copper as the active phase and 7.0-9.0 wt % of ceria as the wash coat. The latter were characterized in order to evaluate present phases, their crystallite size, and ceria lattice parameter by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, specific surface area by N-2 adsorption technique (BET method), and reducibility by temperature programed reduction (TPR). The activity of the catalysts was studied in the water gas shift reaction at low temperature (150-300 degrees C) and at a high gas hourly space velocity (between 3600 and 9500 h(-1)) as a function of preparation parameters (synthesis method and catalyst composition) and operating parameters (temperature and prereduction step). It appeared that the wet impregnation method is the optimized studied method because it led to similar activity to those obtained with a more complex synthesis method (urea-nitrate combustion). The optimized copper and ceria contents are 5.5 and 9.0 wt %, respectively, 30 ppi foam. The study of the temperature effect highlighted the optimum at 300 degrees C without the sintering of metallic copper nor ceria crystallites. Catalytic tests showed in situ activation of the catalyst at 300 degrees C. So, the prereduction step was unnecessary at this temperature. Finally, the more promising catalyst (5.5 wt % of Cu and 9.0 wt % of CeO2) was tested at the outlet of a high temperature water gas shift reactor, and the conditions of the two coupled reactors (high and low reaction temperatures and steam to carbon (S/C) molar ratio) were optimized permitting the reaching of thermodynamic values for methane conversion with 500 degrees C in the high temperature reactor and 350 degrees C and a S/C of 3 in the low temperature reactor.

However, all-in-one (working as solvent, template and reactant precursor) deep eutectic solvent is rarely reported for the construction of electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, the DES formed by cobalt salt and urea was used as an all-in-one platform for the construction of two-dimensional (2D) [Co-(NH3) 4CO3]Cl nanosheets. After activation process, the 2D [Co(NH3)(4)CO3] Cl nanosheets could convert to amorphous CoOOH, resulting in good catalytic performance (outperforming most of the state-of-the-art catalysts) with 291 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and a satisfied Tafel slope (65 mV dec(-1)). Moreover, the long-term stability results indicate its good durability for OER The present all-in-one DES strategy toward OER catalysts might open the door for rational design of advanced catalysts from sustainable way.

Multicomponent reactions (MCR) using HMF offer straightforward access to novel fine chemicals. However, the peculiar reactivity and lower stability of HMF have limited its use in such strategies. In this paper, we report our results on the use of HMF in 3-component Biginelli reactions, leading in one single step to a series of functionalized dihydropyrimidinones obtained in moderate to good yields, with a broad substrate scope of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds and urea building blocks. This is the first report on the use of HMF in this reaction. The CH2OH motif found in HMF provides useful functionalization for the target molecules, which cannot be offered by simpler aldehydes such as furfural.

The morphology and structure of the products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscope and Fourier transformed infrared. The adsorption performance of MgAl-LDH/CoFe2O4 and MgAl-CLDH/CoFe2O4 nanofibres for the removal of an anionic dye (Congo Red, CR) from aqueous solution was investigated. The results showed that MgAl-LDH/CoFe2O4 and MgAl-CLDH/CoFe2O4 nanofibres are particularly efficient in removing CR. The adsorption follows a pseudo-second-order kinetic model and best fits the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacities of MgAl-LDH/CoFe2O4 and MgAl-CLDH/CoFe2O4 nanofibres for CR were found to be 213.2 and 49.8 mg g(-1), respectively. The both adsorption processes were found to be spontaneous and exothermic in nature.

Water splitting driven by electricity generated from renewable energy sources has attracted immense attention for H2 production. The conventional mode of water electrolysis involves two coupled half-reactions: the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Numerous high-performance OER electrocatalysts have been developed to increase the efficiency of the cathodic HER. However, the OER exhibits slow kinetics and high overpotential values, generating the low-economic-value O2 gas which forms the highly damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hazardous H2/O2 mixtures. Therefore, to improve the utility of the anodic reaction and reduce the cost and power implementation of hydrogen production, numerous kinetically and economically favorable oxidation reactions have been proposed to replace the OER as electron donors for integration with the HER. In such hybrid systems, the oxidative potential is used to synthesize valuable chemicals and decompose harmful pollutants. In this review, recent developments in the anodes of conventional and hybrid water splitting technologies have been systematically summarized. Additionally, various alternative anodic reactions and the corresponding 3D integrated electrocatalysts in alkaline media have been highlighted. The technical features, potential challenges, and future perspectives have been thoroughly discussed. This review could promote research on low-voltage hydrogen generation by the electrolysis of renewable organics and harmful wastes.

However, the low efficiency of electron transfer and insufficient surface catalytic sites remain the main obstacles to the development of efficient and selective PMS activators. Herein, we constructed ABO(3) perovskite catalysts (LaCoO3) with adjustable La vacancies (V-La) densities through urea introduction. Experiment, characterization, and theoretical calculation jointly revealed that VLa could not only induce electron delocalization in Co site to enhance the Co 3d - O 2p covalency for accelerating ROS (sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-), singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), and high valent cobalt (Co(IV) = O)) generation, but also trigger the transition of spin-polarization configuration to form Co3+ (t(2g)(5)e(g)(1)) with the intermediate spin state as new active sites for surface-bound PMS* complexes production. The nonradical-dominated and radical-assisted system containing multi-site achieved efficient PMS utilization (95.6 %), excellent decontamination activity (0.753 min(-1)), good mineralization ability (82.7 %), satisfactory acid-base resistance (working pH range 3-11), and environmental robustness for actual water treatment. This study reveals the role of cation vacancy engineering in achieving "Two birds one stone" for PMS activation at the atomic level, which will guide the rational design of Fenton-like catalysts.

Herein, GCN was prepared by thermal condensation of urea and successfully loaded with NiFe2O4 nanoparticles. GCN/NiFe2O4 was characterized by FESEM, HRTEM, IR, XRD, VSM and UV visible spectral analysis. High surface area of GCN/NiFe2O4 was suitable for adsorption coupled photocatalysis. The GCN/NiFe2O4 exhibited significant photocatalytic activity for mineralization of oxytetracycline (OTC) antibiotic under solar light. The OTC was completely mineralized in 8h during simultaneous adsorption and photocatalysis process. The rate of OTC degradation was optimal at pH 5. GCN/NiFe2O4 possessed ferromagnetic behavior and could be easily separated by external magnetic field from waste water. The excellent activity of GCN/NiFe2O4 was due to efficient separation of photogenertaed electron and hole pair. GCN/NiFe2O4 exhibited significant recycle efficiency for ten catalytic cycles.

Six wether adult Dazu black goats were subjected to 3 experimental periods: high HS (group H, temperature-humidity index [THI] > 88) for 15 d, moderate HS (group M, THI was 79-88) for 15 d, and no HS (group L, THI < 72) for 15 d. Rectal temperature (RT) and respiratory rate (RR) were determined on d 7 and 15 of each period, and blood samples were collected on d 15 of each period. All goats received glucose (GLU) tolerance test (GTT) and insulin (INS) tolerance test on d 7 and d 10 of each period. The results showed that HS decreased dry matter intake (DMI) and INS concentration (p < 0.05), and increased RT, RR, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), cortisol (COR), and total protein (TP) concentrations (p < 0.05). Compared to group L, the urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration increased and GLU concentration decreased in group H (p < 0.05). During the GTT, the area under the curve (AUC) of GLU concentrations increased by 12.26% (p > 0.05) and 40.78% (p < 0.05), and AUC of INS concentrations decreased by 26.04 and 14.41% (p < 0.05) in groups H and M compared to group L, respectively. The INS concentrations were not significant among the three groups (p > 0.05) during the ITT. A total of 60 differentially expressed metabolites were identified in response to groups H and M. In HS, changes in metabolites related to carbohydrate metabolism and glycolysis were identified (p < 0.05). The metabolites related to fatty acid beta-oxidation accumulated, glycogenic and ketogenic amino acids were significantly increased, while glycerophospholipid metabolites were decreased in HS (p < 0.05). HS significantly increased 1-methylhistidine, creatinine, betaine, taurine, taurolithocholic acid, inosine, and hypoxanthine, while decreasing vitamin E in blood metabolites (p < 0.05). In summary, HS changed the metabolism of fat, protein, and energy, impaired GLU tolerance, and mainly increased amino acid metabolism to provide energy in Dazu black goats.

In the current study, sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) was used to explore whether it could work like a metabolic modulator to improve glucose and lipid oxidation in pigs fed with an LP diet, whilst glucose (GLUC) was used to evaluate if it could act as pyruvate, which is a metabolic fuel. In particular, we investigated the effects of LP diets supplemented with DCA and GLUC on metabolic responses and intestinal microbiota of finishing pigs. Our findings showed that DCA and GLUC supplementation improved the hepatic lipid metabolism but had limited effects on improving colonic microbiota profile of finishing pigs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of low-protein (LP) diets supplemented with sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) and glucose (GLUC) on metabolic markers and intestinal microbiota of finishing pigs. A total of 80 crossbred growing barrows were allocated randomly to one of the five treatments, including the normal protein level diet (CON), the LP diets, LP with 120 mg/kg DCA (LP + DCA) or 1.8% glucose (LP + GLUC), and LP with 120 mg/kg DCA and 1.8% glucose (LP + DCA + GLUC). The LP diet increased the plasma HDL, triglyceride, and cholesterol concentrations and reduced the bile acid, urea nitrogen, albumin, and total protein concentrations compared to the CON diet (p < 0.05). The LP + DCA + GLUC diet reduced the plasma VLDL, triglyceride, and cholesterol concentrations and increased the bile acid concentration compared with the LP diet (p < 0.05). Pigs fed the LP + DCA and LP + GLUC diets showed reduced 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Reductase content and increased Cytochrome P450 Family 7 Subfamily A Member 1 activity of liver compared that of the CON diet (p < 0.05). Moreover, the LP diets with or without DCA and GLUC supplementation increased the relative abundance of colonic microbiota related to carbohydrate fermentation in finishing pigs. In conclusion, 120 mg/kg DCA or 1.8% GLUC supplementation in an LP diet modulated the hepatic lipid metabolism of pigs, while the DCA along with GLUC supplementation likely improved the lipid metabolism by stimulating bile acid secretion.

To seek the efficient N doping of TiO2 photocatalysts, non-thermal N-2 plasma was employed to treat N-doped TiO2 followed by calcination (N-TiO2 (NTP)) and compared with the conventional calcination (N-TiO2). The samples were evaluated under visible light irradiation for photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO). To elucidate the plasma treatment effect, XRD, SEM, EDS, TEM, BET, UV-vis DRS, FT-IR and XPS techniques were used for catalyst characterization. N-TiO2 (NTP) possessed small particle size of 4.9 nm with better dispersion and narrow band gap of 1.6 eV. The visible-light photocatalytic activity of N-TiO2 (NTP) was much better than that of N-TiO2. And the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of the MO fitted with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood equation. The apparent reaction rate constant of N-TiO2 (NTP) was about 2.8 times as high as that of N-TiO2. The enhancement was ascribed to small particle size of N-doped TiO2 offering more surface active sites and high content of surface oxygen.

Nanoparticles of FeNbO4 Produced by Microwave Assisted Combustion Reaction: a Potential Technology for the Treatment of Wastewater	MATERIALS RESEARCH-IBERO-AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MATERIALS												Iron(III) niobate, FeNbO4, was synthesized for the first time by microwave-assisted combustion reaction between Fe(NO3)(3).9H(2)O and NH4[NbO(C2O4)(2)(H2O)(2)](H2O) in the presence of NH4NO3 and Urea {O=C(NH2)(2)}. Experiments of X-ray powder diffraction revealed a small crystallite size for this material, 16 nm, and the results of MEV showed that it forms agglomerates with diameters between 80 and 180 nm with spherical shapes. HRTEM images revealed that the material is formed by clusters of particles with a diameter near 20 nm. A surface area of 40 m(2)g(-1) was determined by experiments of specific surface area (SSA). The FeNbO4 induced the decomposition of H2O2, forming radicals that, in turn, discoloured Indigo dye Carmine (IC) a solution. The results showed that this niobate was able to degrade 55% of the initial solution in the presence of H2O2 after 360 minutes of reaction time.

Promoter effect of sodium in graphene-supported Ni and Ni-CeO2 catalyst for the low-temperature WGS reaction	APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL												The low temperature water-gas shift (WGS) reaction has been studied over Ni-CeO2/Graphene and Ni/Graphene. The catalysts were prepared with 5 wt.% Ni and 20 wt% CeO2 loadings, by deposition-precipitation employing sodium hydroxide and urea as precipitating agents. The materials were characterized by TEM, powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, H-2-temperature-programmed reduction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The characterization and the reaction results indicated that the interaction between the active species and the support is higher than with activated carbon, and this hinders the reducibility of ceria and thus the catalytic performance. On the other hand, the presence of residual sodium in samples prepared by precipitation with NaOH facilitated the reduction of ceria. The catalytic activity was highly improved in the presence of sodium, what can be explained on the basis of an associative reaction mechanism which is favored over Ni-O-Na entities.

Effect of the Probiotic Bacillus subtilis DE-CA9™ on Fecal Scores, Serum Oxidative Stress Markers and Fecal and Serum Metabolome in Healthy Dogs	VETERINARY SCIENCES												Background: There is increasing interest in the use of Bacillus species as probiotics since their spore-forming ability favors their survival in the acidic gastric environment over other probiotic species. The subsequent germination of B. subtilis to their vegetative form allows for their growth in the small intestine and may increase their beneficial effect on the host. B. subtilis strains have also previously been shown to have beneficial effects in humans and production animals, however, no reports are available so far on their use in companion animals. Study design: The goal of this study was therefore to investigate the daily administration of 1 x 10(9) cfu DE-CA9 (TM) orally per day versus placebo on health parameters, fecal scores, fecal microbiome, fecal metabolomics, as well as serum metabolomics and oxidative stress markers in ten healthy Beagle dogs in a parallel, randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled design over a period of 45 days. Results: DE-CA9 (TM) decreased the oxidative status compared to controls for advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMS), suggesting an antioxidant effect of the treatment. Fecal metabolomics revealed a significant reduction in metabolites associated with tryptophan metabolism in the DE-CA9 (TM)-treated group. DE-CA9 (TM) also significantly decreased phenylalanine and homocysteine and increased homoserine and threonine levels. Amino acid metabolism was also affected in the serum metabolome, with increased levels of urea and cadaverine, and reductions in N-acetylornithine in DE-CA9 (TM) compared to controls. Similarly, changes in essential amino acids were observed, with a significant increase in tryptophan and lysine levels and a decrease in homocysteine. An increase in serum guanine and deoxyuridine was also detected, with a decrease in beta-alanine in the animals that ingested DE-CA9 (TM). Conclusions: Data generated throughout this study suggest that the daily administration of 1 x 10(9) cfu of DE-CA9 (TM) in healthy Beagle dogs is safe and does not affect markers of general health and fecal scores. Furthermore, DE-CA9 (TM) administration had a potential positive effect on some serum markers of oxidative stress, and protein and lipid metabolism in serum and feces.

The as-prepared samples were well characterized by various analytical techniques. The morphological observation showed that hierarchical flower-like BiOCl nanoplates were discretely anchored on the surface of ultra-thin C3N4 nanosheets. The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared photocatalysts was evaluated by degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible-light irradiation. The results showed that BC/CN photocatalyst exhibited enhanced photostability and photocatalytic performance in the degradation process. On the basis of experimental results and the analysis of band energy structure, it could be inferred that the enhanced photocatalytic performance of BC/CN photocatalyst was intimately related with the hybridization of hierarchical flower-like BiOCl nanoplates with ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets, which provided good adsorptive capacity, extended light absorption, suppressed the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, and facilitated charge transfer efficiently.					邓, 兆/G-9409-2012; Zhao, Junwei/L-7535-2019	Zhao, Junwei/0000-0002-5366-1107													2073-4352					SEP	2017	7	9							266	10.3390/cryst7090266	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cryst7090266													WOS:000412049600010

Solid particle erosion studies of ceramic oxides reinforced water-based PU nanocomposite coatings for wind turbine blade protection	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL												Wind energy has been regarded to be one of the renewable energies to rely on for the future. In tropical countries like India maintenance of wind turbine blades is a challenging task. Solid particle erosion is one of the root causes of wind turbine blade damage resulting in reduction in energy production. In the present study, in-house synthesized ceramic oxide nanoparticles such as Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 are used as fillers for reinforcement of water based polyurethane (PU) coatings on glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) substrates for solid particle erosion resistance for the first time. Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 nanoparticles have been prepared by solution combustion synthesis method using urea, glycine, and oxalyl dihydrazide, respectively, as fuels. These ceramic nanoparticles are found to crystallize in corundum, tetragonal, and cubic structures, respectively, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies. Field emission scanning electron microscopy shows the porous microstructure of the oxide products due to the release of gases in course of preparation. Transmission electron microscopy studies of these nanoparticles show corresponding lattice fringes in their high-resolution images. Observed Al-O, Zr-O, and Ce-O vibrational modes in Raman spectra confirm the formation of corresponding oxides. The oxidation states of Al, Zr, and Ce in the respective oxides are found to be +3, +4, and +4, respectively, as demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The nanocomposite coatings consisting of PU and Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 nano particles have been developed by a simple spray method on GFRP substrates. The solid particle erosion resistance tests of coatings have been studied at varied concentrations of Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 nanoparticles at impinging angles of 30 degrees and 90 degrees. It has been observed that ZrO2, and CeO2 nanoparticles-reinforced PU coatings show better solid particle erosion resistance compared to Al2O3-reinforced coating. Among different concentrations studied here, coatings with 15 wt% filler concentrations offer a relatively low erosion rate than the other concentrations at both impinging angles. However, GFRP substrate and PU coating are observed to show much higher erosion rate compared to nanoparticles reinforced PU coatings.

Both experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated that sulfur and nitrogen co-doping could synergistically enhance the catalytic performance for activating peroxydisulfate (PDS) compared to the original and N doped graphene aerogels. The ratio of sulfur/nitrogen in the aerogel can be controlled by regulating the additions of thiourea and urea sources, and the aerogel with the S/N ratio of about 1:2.5 shows a better catalytic effect due to more significant changes in the electrostatic potential and the surface charge distribution, as revealed by the theoretical simulations. The radical quenching tests indicated that both SO4 center dot(- )and center dot OH radicals could be formed in the SN-rGO aerogel + PDS system and contribute most to RhB degradation.

J	Wang, XL; Wei, WP; Qi, YY; Dong, LH; Zhang, Y				Wang, Xiaolu; Wei, Wenpeng; Qi, Yanyan; Dong, Lihua; Zhang, Yun			Clinical Effects of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine in Treating Severe Preeclampsia and Its Influence on Maternal and Infant Outcomes after Cesarean Section under Combined Lumbar and Epidural Anesthesia	EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE												Objective. This study is aimed to observe the clinical effects of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine in treating severe preeclampsia (SPE) and its effects on maternal and infant outcomes after cesarean section under combined lumbar and epidural anesthesia. Method. One hundred and sixty-six pregnant women with SPE were randomly divided into an experimental group and control group, with 83 cases in each group. The control group was given conventional treatments such as magnesium sulfate, and the experimental group received self-made traditional Chinese medicine decoction for oral administration. Results. The total clinical effective rate of treatment in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group. After treatment, the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and 24 h proteinuria (24 h PRO) levels of the experimental group were significantly lower than those of the control group. After cesarean section (c-section) under combined lumbar and epidural anesthesia, there were statistically significant differences in placental abruption, uterine weakness, fetal intrauterine distress, and neonatal asphyxia in the experimental group, while there were no significant differences in oligohydramnios. After treatment, the contents of inflammatory factors in both groups decreased, and the decrease was more prominent in the experimental group. After treatment, the levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr), and albumin (Alb) and beta 2 microglobulin (beta 2-MG) of the two groups of patients decreased, and the levels of them in the experimental group decreased. After treatment, the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the two groups increased. However, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid peroxide (LPO), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) all reduced, and the increase or decrease in the experimental group was more prominent. Conclusion. The combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine can reduce the blood pressure of a patient with SPE. After the combined spinal-epidural anesthesia and cesarean section, it can significantly improve the maternal and infant outcomes and renal function, reduce inflammatory factors levels and body oxidative stress, and increase the activities of antioxidant enzymes.

Blockade of the Lysophosphatidylserine Lipase ABHD12 Potentiates Ferroptosis in Cancer Cells	ACS CHEMICAL BIOLOGY												Ferroptosis is a type of cell death caused by the pathogenic accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides. Pharmacological mechanisms to induce ferroptosis may provide a way to kill cancer cells that are resistant to other forms of cell death like apoptosis. Nonetheless, the proteins that regulate ferroptotic sensitivity in cancer cells remain incompletely understood. Here, we screened a panel of inhibitors of serine hydrolases-an enzyme class important for regulating lipid metabolism-for potentiation of ferroptosis in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells. We found that DO264, a selective inhibitor of the lyso- and ox-phosphatidylserine (PS) lipase ABHD12, enhances ferroptotic death caused by RSL3, an inhibitor of the lipid peroxidase GPX4. RSL3-induced ferroptosis was also potentiated by genetic disruption of ABHD12. Metabolomic experiments revealed that, in addition to elevated lyso-PS, ABHD12-inactivated cells show higher quantities of arachidonate (C20:4)-containing PS and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, pointing to potential oxidation-sensitive lipid mediators of ferroptosis regulated by ABHD12.

By combining electrochemical techniques, with ex situ field emission scanning electron microscopy, high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, the effect of water content on the electrochemical processes occurring during nickel deposition was better understood. At highly negative potentials and depending on water content, Ni growth is halted due to water splitting and formation of a mixed layer of Ni/NiOx(OH)(2(1-x)(ads)). Moreover, under certain conditions, the DES components can also be (electro)chemically reduced at the electrode surface, blocking further three-dimensional growth of the Ni NPs. Hence, a two-dimensional crystalline Ni-containing network can be formed in the interparticle region.

However, ideal ROSactivated molecular triggers that possess high sensitivity and easy functionalization for tailoring specific prodrugs, remain scarce. In this work, we developed a highly reactive oxygen species (hROS, such as center dot OH, ONOOand HOCl)-responsive molecular trigger (namely FDROS-4) through the conjunction of methylene blue (MB) and 2, 6-bis (hydroxymethyl) aniline via urea bond, integrating imaging and therapeutic functions. FDROS-4 could be readily modified as multifunctional prodrugs and efficiently activated by hROS, leading to the release of nearinfrared emissive MB and parent drugs. By using chlorambucil as a model drug and incorporating varying numbers of galactose as liver-targeting ligands, we designed and synthesized a series of prodrugs named FDROS6, FDROS-7, and FDROS-8. The optimal prodrug, FDROS-7, could self-assemble into monocomponent nanoparticles, exhibiting enhanced biocompatibility and therapeutic efficacy compared to the parent drug. This hROS-activated molecular trigger holds promise for the development of stimulus-responsive prodrugs in chemotherapy.																			0168-3659	1873-4995				DEC	2024	376						961	971		10.1016/j.jconrel.2024.10.054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2024.10.054		NOV 2024						39476874					WOS:001353094500001
J	Dalkiran, B; Bekirog, H				Dalkiran, Berna; Bekirog, Havva			Facile fabrication of NaOH nanorods on pencil graphite electrode for simultaneous electrochemical detection of natural antioxidants by deep eutectic solvent	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												We report the application of deep eutectic solvents (DES) based on ethylene glycol and urea as low-cost, green, and suitable electrolytes for electrochemical studies. The main aim of this study was to explore the capabilities of DES as an enhancer of electrochemical detection for the natural antioxidants of ascorbic acid (AA) and gallic acid (GA). A simple fabrication of a disposable and effective electrochemical sensing platform for the simultaneous determination of AA and GA based on the one-step electrochemical deposition of NaOH nanorods on pencil graphite electrode (PGE) was performed. The electrochemical behavior showed that the two antioxidants, AA and GA, could be electro-oxidized and discriminated simultaneously on the surface of the NaOH/PGE. The oxidation potentials of AA and GA shifted slightly towards negative, and the peak current values increased 2.0fold in DES than in BR buffer medium. Due to the strong synergistic effect between the nanostructures of NaOH (large effective surface area) and DES (high electrical conductivity), the proposed electrode led to the enhancement analytical performances towards AA and GA. Cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine the modified electrode's morphological and electrochemical characterization and performance parameters. The developed sensor exhibited good performance towards the determination of AA and GA with a low detection limit (1.4 mu M for AA and 0.6 mu M for GA), wide linear concentration ranges (2-200 mu M for AA and 1-30 mu M for GA), and good reproducibility (1.4 % for AA and 0.4 % for GA). The effects of possible interferences were investigated for their effect on the determination of AA and GA. With good selectivity and sensitivity, the sensor's reliability for the simultaneous detection of AA and GA in mineral water (flavored with green tea and vitamin C) was successfully tested. The mean analytical recovery was 100.4 +/- 2.5 and 96.2 +/- 0.6 for AA and GA, respectively. The results obtained with the presented sensor were confirmed by the HPLC method. This is a promising approach for the determination of the detection of AA and GA in different water samples.					dalkıran, berna/AAD-9479-2021; Bekiroğlu Ataş, Havva/AAR-2422-2020	BEKIROGLU ATAS, HAVVA/0000-0002-4829-6969; dalkiran, berna/0000-0002-9972-5970													0013-4686	1873-3859				JAN 10	2024	474								143456	10.1016/j.electacta.2023.143456	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2023.143456		NOV 2023											WOS:001124914700001

Here, we aimed to determine the resemblance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines to human liver tumours, specifically in the expression of deregulated metabolic targets in clinical tissue samples. Methods: We compared the overall gene expression profile of poorly-differentiated (HLE, HLF, SNU-449) to well-differentiated (HUH7, HEPG2, HEP3B) HCC cell lines in three publicly available microarray datasets. Three thousand and eighty-five differentially expressed genes in >= 2 datasets (P < 0.05) were used for pathway enrichment and gene ontology (GO) analyses. Further, we compared the topmost gene expression, pathways, and GO from poorly differentiated cell lines to the pattern from four human HCC datasets (623 tumour tissues). In well- versus poorly differentiated cell lines, and in representative models HLE and HUH7 cells, we specifically assessed the expression pattern of 634 consistently deregulated metabolic genes in human HCC. These data were complemented by quantitative PCR, proteomics, metabolomics and assessment of response to thirteen metabolism-targeting compounds in HLE versus HUH7 cells. Results: We found that poorly-differentiated HCC cells display upregulated MAPK/RAS/NFkB signaling, focal adhesion, and downregulated complement/coagulation cascade, PPAR-signaling, among pathway alterations seen in clinical tumour datasets. In HLE cells, 148 downregulated metabolic genes in liver tumours also showed low gene/protein expression - notably in fatty acid beta-oxidation (e.g. ACAA1/2, ACADSB, HADH), urea cycle (e.g. CPS1, ARG1, ASL), molecule transport (e.g. SLC2A2, SLC7A1, SLC25A15/20), and amino acid metabolism (e.g. PHGDH, PSAT1, GOT1, GLUD1). In contrast, HUH7 cells showed a higher expression of 98 metabolic targets upregulated in tumours (e.g. HK2, PKM, PSPH, GLUL, ASNS, and fatty acid synthesis enzymes ACLY, FASN). Metabolomics revealed that the genomic portrait of HLE cells co-exist with profound reliance on glutamine to fuel tricarboxylic acid cycle, whereas HUH7 cells use both glucose and glutamine. Targeting glutamine pathway selectively suppressed the proliferation of HLE cells. Conclusions: We report a yet unappreciated distinct expression pattern of clinically-relevant metabolic genes in HCC cell lines, which could enable the identification and therapeutic targeting of metabolic vulnerabilities at various liver cancer stages.

J	Radic, I; Runje, M; Babic, S				Radic, Irena; Runje, Mislav; Babic, Sandra			Development of an analytical method for the determination of pimavanserin and its impurities applying analytical quality by design principles as a risk-based strategy	JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS												Pimavanserin is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis. As it is a relatively new drug on the market, limited number of pharmacokinetic information and analytical methods are available. This paper presents an ultra-high performance chromatography for the simultaneous determination of pimavanserin and its four process impurities. The method was developed applying analytical quality by design (AQbD) principles as a risk based approach. Critical method attributes (CMAs) were selected as a resolution between the worst separated compounds (impurity B and impurity C), a duration of analysis defined by the retention time of the last eluting peak (impurity D), a capacity factor of the first eluted impurity (impurity A), a tailing factor and a theoretical plate number. Risk assessment in the early stage of method development pointed out critical method parameters (CMPs): column temperature, gradient time and pH-value of the mobile phase (water phase, eluent A). Design of experiments (DoE), using DryLab (R) 4 software, was applied to evaluate the influence of CMPs on CMAs and to determine method operable design region (MODR). Based on the risk assessment and the results of robustness and precision tests, a control strategy with system suitability criteria was proposed. Developed method was validated according to ICH Q2 (R1) guideline with respect to the selectivity, LOD, LOQ, linearity, precision, accuracy, robustness and stability. A forced degradation study was performed to provide an evidence of the stability-indicating property of the method. Degradation products of pimavanserin were identified using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-qTOF). Additionally, potential degradation products were assessed in silico with the help of Zeneth (R) software and good agreement with experimentally identified degradation products was achieved. Main degradation products were formed during acid and base hydrolysis (m/z 223.16 [M+H](+) at RRT 0.37) and under oxidative stress conditions (m/z 444.26 [M+H](+) at RRT 0.57). The results revealed that the pimavanserin undergoes degradation through acid and base hydrolysis of urea and N-oxidation of aliphatic tertiary amine. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CIMDRN	Experiences of caregivers of children with inherited metabolic diseases: a qualitative study	ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES												Background: We sought to understand the experiences of parents/caregivers of children with inherited metabolic diseases (IMD) in order to inform strategies for supporting patients and their families. We investigated their experiences regarding the management of disease, its impact on child and family life, and interactions with the health care system. Methods: From four Canadian centres, we conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with parents/caregivers of children with an IMD who were born between 2006 and 2015 and who were participating in a larger cohort study. Participants were selected with the aim of achieving a diverse sample with respect to treatment centre, IMD, and age of the child. Interviews emphasized the impacts of the disease and its treatment on the child and family and explicitly queried perceptions of interactions with the health care system. We identified emergent themes from the interview data. Results: We completed interviews with 21 parents/caregivers. The 21 children were aged < 1 to 7 years old with IMD that included amino acid disorders, urea cycle disorders, fatty acid oxidation disorders, and organic acid disorders or 'other' IMD. Most parents reported that they and their families had adapted well to their child's diagnosis. Parents used proactive coping strategies to integrate complex disease management protocols into routine family life. An important source of stress was concern about the social challenges faced by their children. Participants reported positive interactions with their most involved health care providers within the metabolic clinic. However, they reported challenges associated with the health care system outside of disease-specific metabolic care, when encountering systems and providers unfamiliar with the child's disease. Conclusions: The successful use of proactive coping strategies among parents of children with IMD in this study suggests the potential value of promoting positive coping and is an important direction for future study. Parents' social concerns for their children were important stressors that warrant consideration by health care providers positioned to support families. Our results with respect to experiences with care highlight the important role of specialized metabolic clinics and point to a need for better coordination of the care that takes place outside the disease-specific management of IMD.

The effect of the pyrolysis temperature (500-800 degrees C) on the nitrogen species present in the catalysts is thoroughly studied. These nitrogen species formed by the pyrolysis are proven to be the active sites for the chemical conversion. These catalysts containing a significant amount of nitrogen with a high degree of defects display excellent catalytic activity towards the reduction of nitro-compounds. The effect of solvents, reaction time, and temperature in nitrobenzene reduction reaction is also studied. This protocol can be easily utilized industrially due to its several excellent features such as short reaction time, use of green solvent, column chromatography free, and applicable to the gram scale. Besides, after the reaction, the NCS catalyst can be easily recovered and reused up to five runs without significant loss on its catalytic activity. [GRAPHICS] .

Here, we focus on functional differences and individual contribution of acyl coA synthetases (ACSL) isoforms to the previously described ACSL/stearoyl-CoA desaturase (ACSL1/ACSL4/SCD) metabolic network causing invasion and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). ACSL4 fuels proliferation and migration accompanied by a more glycolytic phenotype. Conversely, ACSL1 stimulates invasion displaying a lower basal respiratory rate. Acylcarnitines elevation, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) lower levels, and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) upregulation characterize the individual overexpression of ACSL1, ACSL4 and SCD, respectively. However, the three enzymes simultaneous overexpression results in upregulated phospholipids and urea cycle derived metabolites. Thus, the metabolic effects caused by the network are far from being caused by the individual contributions of each enzyme. Furthermore, ACSL/SCD network produces more energetically efficient cells with lower basal respiration levels and upregulated creatine pathway. These features characterize other invasive CRC cells, thus, ACSL/SCD network exemplifies specific metabolic adaptations for invasive cancer cells.

J	Gowri, VM; John, SA				Gowri, Veeramani Mangala; John, S. Abraham			Fabrication of bulk, nanosheets and quantum dots of graphitic carbon nitride on electrodes: Morphology dependent electrocatalytic activity	JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												The present work aims to find a suitable morphology of graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) for electrocatalytic applications which includes bulk g-CN (g-CNB), g-CN nanosheets (g-CNNS) and g-CN quantum dots (gCND). The different morphologies of g-CN were synthesized by solid-phase thermal method using urea, citric acid and trisodium citrate as precursors. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of g-CNs showed characteristic 2 theta values due to (002) interlayer diffraction and (100) in-plane structural packing. The g-CN with the morphology of bulk, sheets and dots were then attached directly on GC electrode by immersing it into the respective gCN solution. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that the g-CNB coated on GC plate displays layer like structure whereas g-CNNS exhibits crumpled and enfolded thin sheets like graphene. The SEM image of g-CND coated GC plate shows that they were uniformly covered the whole area as dots with the size of 30 nm. Under optimized conditions, the electrochemical impedance studies showed that the order of the charge transfer resistance was as follows: g-CNNS <g-CND < g-CNB < GC. The impact of g-CN morphology on the oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA) and dopamine (DA) and the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (HP) was studied at pH 7.2 phosphate buffer (PB) solution. The g-CNs modified electrodes irrespective of the morphology enhanced the electrocatalytic activity in contrast to bare GC electrode. Among the three g-CNs, GC/g-CNNS electrode exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity towards all the three analytes. The cause for the higher electrocatalytic activity was attributed to its higher electroactive surface area and faster electron transfer rate in contrast to GC/g-CNB and GC/g-CND electrodes. Further, GC/g-CNNS electrode was effectively used for the sensitive determination of HP. While increasing its concentration from 100 nM to 1 mM, HP reduction current increases linearly with R2 value of 0.9905 and LOD was 11 nM (S/N = 3). Finally, GC/g-CNNS electrode was successfully used to quantify HP in blood serum samples.

Herein, the graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)/TiVCTx 3 N 4 )/TiVCT x composite was fabricated through in situ pyrolysis of urea to generate g-C3N4 3 N 4 nano- sheets on the surface of TiVCTx x nanosheets. The as-prepared g-C3N4 3 N 4 protective layer can reduce the degree of oxidation of TiVCTx x MXene, restrain the re-stacking of TiVCTx x nanosheets and minimize the risk of undesirable side reactions. As expected, the g-C3N4/TiVCTx 3 N 4 /TiVCT x electrode exhibits remarkable specific capacity of 1025.3 mAh/g after 150 cycles at 0.1 A/g and 558.3 mAh/g after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A/g for LIBs and a high specific capacitance of 508.9F g- 1 in 0.5 M Na2SO4 2 SO 4 electrolyte at 1.0 A/g after 7000 cycles for supercapacitors (SCs). Furthermore, the assembled g-C3N4/TiVCTx-30//LiFePO4 3 N 4 /TiVCT x-30//LiFePO 4 full cell presents stable specific capacity of 505.5 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g after 100 cycles and 255.2 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g along with a Coulombic efficiency of 97.9 % after 50 cycles at- 20 degrees C, demonstrating excellent low temperature tolerance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results indicated that the g-C3N4/TiVCTx-30 3 N 4 /TiVCT x-30 exhibits strongest adsorption capacity for Li+ + with an adsorption energy of-3.85 eV. The introduction of g-C3N4 3 N 4 improves the insertion and extraction kinetics of Li+, + , effectively reducing the diffusion barrier. Consequently, the g-C3N4/TiVCTx-30 3 N 4 /TiVCT x-30 electrode exhibits potential application prospects in high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices. Our work provides valuable insights and significant research implications for improving the specific capacity and stability of TiVCTx x MXene in the field of energy storage.																			1385-8947	1873-3212				OCT 1	2024	497								154449	10.1016/j.cej.2024.154449	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.154449		AUG 2024											WOS:001288721900001

Present-day archaeal diversity in soils globally is dominated by members of the class Nitrososphaeria. The evolutionary radiation of this class is thought to reflect adaptations to a wide range of temperatures, pH, and other environmental conditions. However, the mechanisms that govern competition and coexistence among Nitrososphaeria lineages in soil remain poorly understood. Here we show that predominant soil Nitrososphaeria lineages compose a patchwork of gene inventory and expression profiles for ammonia, urea, and phosphate utilization. In contrast, carbon fixation, respiration, and ATP synthesis genes are conserved and expressed consistently among predominant phylotypes across 12 major evolutionary lineages commonly found in soil. In situ gene expression profiles closely resemble pure culture reference strains under optimal growth conditions. Together, these results reveal resource-based coexistence patterns among Nitrososphaeria lineages and suggest complementary ecophysiological niches associated with differential nutrient acquisition strategies among globally predominant archaeal lineages in soil.

For this purpose, we experimented on 180 one-day-old broiler chickens. The feed was administered to broiler chicks of groups 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9 chromium @ (270 mg.kg(-1) BW). Groups 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 were administered arsenic @ (50 mg.kg(-1) BW). Groups 4, 7, and 9 received vitamin E (150 mg.kg(-1) BW), and groups 5, 8, and 9 received bentonite (5%), respectively. Group 1 was kept in control. All the broiler chicks treated with chromium and arsenic showed a significant (p < 0.05) decline in erythrocytic parameters on experimental days 21 and 42. Total proteins decreased significantly, while ALT, AST, urea, and creatinine increased significantly (p < 0.05). TAC and CAT decreased significantly (p < 0.05), while TOC and MDA concentrations increased significantly (p < 0.05) in chromium and arsenic-treated groups on experimental days 21 and 42. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between TAC and CAT (Pearson correlation value = 0.961; p < 0.001), similarly TOC and MDA positive correlation (Pearson correlation value = 0.920; p < 0.001). However, TAC and CAT showed a negative correlation between TOC and MDA. The intensity of gross and microscopic lesions was more in chromium (270 mg.kg(-1)) and arsenic (50 mg.kg(-1)) singly or in combination-treated groups. Thus, broiler chicks treated with chromium plus arsenic exhibited higher gross and microscopic lesion intensity than other treated groups. Fatty degeneration, severe cytoplasmic vacuolar degeneration, and expansion of sinusoidal spaces were the main lesions observed in the liver. Kidneys showed renal epithelial cells necrosis, glomerular shrinkage, and severe cytoplasmic vacuolar degeneration. Co-administration of bentonite along with chromium and arsenic resulted in partial amelioration (group 8) compared to groups 7 and 9, administered arsenic + chromium + vitamin E and arsenic + chromium + vitamin E + bentonite, respectively. It was concluded that arsenic and chromium cause damage not only to haemato-biochemical parameters but also lead to oxidation stress in broilers. Vitamin E and bentonite administration can ameliorate toxicity and oxidative stress produced by arsenic and chromium.

J	Theis, JR				Theis, Joseph R.			An assessment of Pt and Pd model catalysts for low temperature NOx adsorption	CATALYSIS TODAY					24th North American Meeting (NAM) of the North-American-Catalysis-Society	JUN 14-19, 2015	Pittsburgh, PA	N Amer Catalysis Soc				Low temperature NOx adsorbers (LTNA) are being developed to adsorb the cold start NOx emissions from diesel engines and release the NOx when the urea/SCR system is operational. To assess the contributions of the precious metal and washcoat, model catalysts with 0.43 g/L (26 gpcf) of platinum (Pt) or palladium (Pd) on washcoats of alumina (Al2O3) or ceria/zirconia (CZO) were evaluated for lean NO storage and release with and without C2H4 and H2O. The degreened samples were evaluated on a reactor-based transient test that partially simulated the exhaust temperatures during the first two phases of the light-duty Federal Test Procedure (FTP) followed by a Supplemental FTP (U506) test. After oxidation, the Pd/CZO catalyst stored NO at the lowest temperatures of the test (similar to 90 degrees C) without C2H4 and H2O, and the NO storage was enhanced by the presence of C2H4 but inhibited by H2O at bed temperature under 100 degrees C. Most of the NOx emissions during the FTP simulation were in the form of NO, and the catalyst produced low N2O levels on tests with C2H4. The oxidized Pd/Al2O3 sample exhibited poor NO storage with or without C2H4 and H2O, suggesting that cerium is important for NOx storage when the catalyst is oxidized. Both Pd technologies stored more NO when the samples were reduced, indicating that metallic Pd is effective for storing NO. The Pd/Al2O3 sample exhibited high NO storage efficiency between 90 & 120 degrees C without H2O & C2H4 but lower efficiency with these species. Above 120 degrees C, the catalyst produced high NO2 levels and high N2O levels on the tests with C2H4. The Pt/CZO sample performed similarly to the Pd/CZO sample except for higher NO2 and N2O levels. The Pd/CZO catalyst provided the best combination of NO storage with Pd/Al2O3 above 100 degrees C, essentially complete NOx release at the maximum bed temperature of the US06 simulation (400 degrees C), low NO2 and N2O formation, and cost effectiveness.

Studies have found that acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) can reduce cerebral edema and neurological complications in TBI patients. It significantly improves their neurobehavioral and neurocognitive functions. ALC has also been shown to have a neuroprotective effect in cases of global and focal cerebral ischemia. Moreover, it is an effective agent in reducing nephrotoxicity by suppressing downstream mitochondrial fragmentation. LC can reduce the severity of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, renal cast formation, tubular necrosis, iron accumulation in the tubular epithelium, CK activity, urea levels, Cr levels, and MDA levels and restore the function of enzymes such as SOD, catalase, and GPx. LC can also be administered to patients with hyperammonemia (HA), as it can suppress ammonia levels. It is important to note, however, that LC levels are dysregulated in various conditions such as aging, cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, malnutrition, sepsis, endocrine disorders, diabetes, trauma, starvation, obesity, and medication interactions. There is limited research on the effects of LC supplementation in critical illnesses such as TBI, AKI, and HA. This scarcity of studies highlights the need for further research in this area.																				2218-1989				JUL	2024	14	7							363	10.3390/metabo14070363	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/metabo14070363								39057686					WOS:001277599800001

Herein, we report an efficient strategy to impregnate Au species onto uncalcined TS-1 using a sulphur-containing gold precursor, i.e., sodium dithiosulfatoaurate, for propylene epoxidation with H-2 and O-2 to produce propylene oxide (PO). Such catalyst delivers superior activity than the referenced catalyst prepared by impregnation using (sodium) aurichloride precursor and the catalyst prepared by deposition-precipitant urea (DPU) method. The catalyst structure-performance relationship is established by using multiple microscopy and spectroscopy techniques. The sulphur species contained in the Au precursor can serve as protecting-ligands, thus facilitating the formation of highly dispersed Au species on uncalcined TS-1. This finding may also provide a way for the preparation of highly efficient impregnated Au-based catalysts for other reactions.

Ginsenoside Re was the major pharmacologic ingredient found abundantly in ginseng. However, the anti-diabetic of Ginsenoside Re and its underlying mechanism in metabolic level are still unclear. Serum and urine metabolomic method was carried out to investigate the anti-diabetic pharmacological effects and the potential mechanism of Ginsenoside Re on high-fat diet combined streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole exactive orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap/MS). Serum and urine samples were collected from the control group (CON), T2DM group, metformin (MET) treatment group, and ginsenoside Re treatment group after intervention. The biochemical parameters of serum were firstly analyzed. The endogenous metabolites in serum and urine were detected by UHPLC-MS. The potential metabolites were screened by multivariate statistical analysis and identified by accurate mass measurement, MS/MS, and metabolite databases. The anti-diabetic-related metabolites were analyzed by KEGG metabolic pathway, and its potential mechanism was discussed. The treatment of ginsenoside Re significantly reduced the blood glucose and serum lipid level improved the oxidative stress caused by T2DM. Biochemical parameters (urea nitrogen, uric acid) showed that ginsenoside Re could improve renal function in T2DM rats. Respective 2 and 6 differential metabolites were found and identified in serum and urine of ginsenoside Re compared with T2DM group and enriched in KEGG pathway. Metabolic pathways analysis indicated that the differential metabolites related to T2DM were mainly involved in arachidonic acid metabolism, Vitamin B6, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and bile secretion metabolic pathways. This study verified the anti-diabetic and anti-oxidation effects of ginsenoside Re, elaborated that ginsenoside Re has a good regulation of the metabolic disorder in T2DM rats, which could promote insulin secretion, stimulated cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1), and CaMKK beta to activate AMPK signaling pathway, inhibited insulin resistance, and improved blood glucose uptake and diabetic nephropathy, so as to play the role of anti-diabetic.

Novel Electrochemical Molecularly Imprinted Polymer-Based Biosensor for Tau Protein Detection	CHEMOSENSORS												A novel electrochemical biosensor based on a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was developed for the impedimetric determination of Tau protein, a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Indeed, a recent correlation between AD symptoms and the presence of Tau proteins in their aggregated form made hyperphosphorylated Tau protein (Tangles) a promising biomarker for Alzheimer's diagnosis. The MIP was directly assembled on a screen-printed carbon electrode (C-SPE) and prepared by electropolymerization of 3-aminophenol (AMP) in the presence of the protein template (p-Tau-441) using cyclic voltammetry. The p-Tau-441 protein bound to the polymeric backbone was digested by the action of the proteolytic activity of proteinase K in urea and then washed away to create vacant sites. The performances of the corresponding imprinted and non-imprinted electrodes were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The detection limit of the MIP-based sensors was 0.02 pM in PBS buffer pH 5.6. Good selectivity and good results in serum samples were obtained with the developed platform. The biosensor described in this work is a potential tool for screening Tau protein on-site and an attractive complement to clinically established methodologies methods as it is easy to fabricate, has a short response time and is inexpensive.

Sirtuin 1 deletion increases inflammation and mortality in sepsis	JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY					35th Annual Scientific Assembly of the Eastern-Association-for-the-Surgery-of-Trauma (EAST)	JAN 11-15, 2022	Austin, TX	Eastern Assoc Surg Trauma				BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a hyperinflammatory response to infection that can lead to multiorgan failure and eventually death. Often, the onset of multiorgan failure is heralded by renal dysfunction. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) promotes cellular stress resilience by inhibiting inflammation and promoting mitochondria! function. We hypothesize that SIRT1 plays an important role in limiting the inflammatory responses that drive organ failure in sepsis, predominantly via expression in myeloid cells. METHODS: We performed meal ligation and puncture (CLP) on whole body SIRT1 knockout (S1KO) and myeloid cell-specific S1KO (S1KO-LysMCre) mice on a C57BL/6J background. Serum interleukin (IL)-6 was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Renal mitochondria] complex activity was measured using Oxygraph-2k (Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was measured from serum. Survival was monitored for up to 5 days. RESULTS: Following CIT. SI KO mice had decreased renal mitochondrial complex I-dependent respiratory capacity (241.7 vs. 418.3 mrnolO2/mg/min, p = 0.018) and renal mitochondria] complex II-dependent respiratory capacity (932.3 vs. 1,178.4,p = 0.027), as well as reduced rates of fatty acid oxidation (1873 vs. 250.3, p = 0.022). Sirtuin 1 knockout mice also had increased BUN (48.0 mg/dL vs. 16.0 mg/dL, p = 0.049). Interleukin-6 levels were elevated in S1KO mice (96.5 ng/mL vs. 45.6 ng/mL, p = 0.028) and S1KO-LysMCre mice (35.8 ng/mL vs. 24.5 ng/mL, p = 0.033) compared with controls 12 hours after surgery. Five-day survival in S1KO (33.3% vs. 83.3%, p = 0.025) and S I KO-LysMCre (60% vs. 100%,p= 0.049) mice was decreased compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Sirtuin 1 deletion increases systemic inflammation in sepsis. Renal mitochondrial dysfunction, kidney injury, and mortality following CLP were all exacerbated by SIRT1 deletion. Similar effects on inflammation and survival were seen following myeloid cell-specific SIRT1 deletion, indicating that SIRT1 activity in myeloid cells may be a significant contributor for the protective effects of SIRE1 in sepsis.

J	Afreen, S; Muthoosamy, K; Manickam, S; Hashim, U				Afreen, Sadia; Muthoosamy, Kasturi; Manickam, Sivakumar; Hashim, Uda			Functionalized fullerene (C60) as a potential nanomediator in the fabrication of highly sensitive biosensors	BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS												Designing a biosensor for versatile biomedical applications is a sophisticated task and how dedicatedly functionalized fullerene (C-60) can perform on this stage is a challenge for today and tomorrow's nanoscience and nanotechnology. Since the invention of biosensor, many ideas and methods have been invested to upgrade the functionality of biosensors. Due to special physicochemical characteristics, the novel carbon material "fullerene" adds a new dimension to the construction of highly sensitive biosensors. The prominent aspects of fullerene explain its outstanding performance in biosensing devices as a mediator, e.g. fullerene in organic solvents exhibits five stages of reversible oxidation/reduction, and hence fullerene can work either as an electrophile or nudeophile. Fullerene is stable and its spherical structure produces an angle strain which allows it to undergo characteristic reactions of addition to double bonds (hybridization which turns from sp(2) to sp(3)). Research activities are being conducted worldwide to invent a variety of methods of fullerene functionalization with a purpose of incorporating it effectively in biosensor devices. The different types of functionalization methods include modification of fullerene into water soluble derivatives and conjugation with enzymes and/or other biomolecules, e.g. urease, glucose oxidase, hemoglobin, myoglobin (Mb), conjugation with metals e.g. gold (Au), chitosan (CS), ferrocene (Fc), etc. to enhance the sensitivity of biosensors. The state-of-the-art research on fullerene functionalization and its application in sensor devices has proven that fullerene can be implemented successfully in preparing biosensors to detect glucose level in blood serum, urea level in urine solution, hemoglobin, immunoglobulin, glutathione in real sample for pathological purpose, to identify doping abuse, to analyze pharmaceutical preparation and even to detect cancer and tumor cells at an earlier stage. Employing fullerene-metal matrix for the detection of tumor and cancer cells is also possible by the inclusion of fullerene in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) known as peapods as well as in double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs), to augment the effectiveness of biosensors. This review discusses various approaches that have been reported for functionalizing fullerene (C-60) derivatives and their application in different types of biosensor fabrication. (C) Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A total of 169 patients with NICCD who have biallelic pathogenic SLC25A13 variants detected by targeted next-generation sequencing were collected. They were divided into the "Newborn-screen Group " and "Clinical diagnosed Group " depending on the newborn screening results. Amino acid and acylcarnitine profiles were measured by MS/MS. The total bile acids, blood amino acids and acylcarnitines, general biochemistry, blood count, and coagulation parameters were monitored every 2-3 months. We compared the differences in metabolic indices and their dynamic changes between these two groups. The Mann-Whitney test and orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) were used for statistical analysis. Results: At the onset of NICCD, we found that the "Clinical diagnosed Group " had higher levels of intermediate products of the urea cycle, free carnitine, and short-chain and long-chain acylcarnitines than those in the "Newborn-screen Group, " but the levels of ketogenic/glucogenic amino acids and several medium-chain acylcarnitines were lower. Furthermore, concentrations of direct bilirubin, total bile acid, lactate, prothrombin time, and several liver enzymes were significantly higher while total protein, amylase, and hemoglobin were lower in the "Clinical diagnosed Group " than in the "Newborn-screen Group. " Dynamic change analysis showed that direct bilirubin, albumin, arginine, and citrulline were the earliest metabolic derangements to reach peak levels in NICCD groups, followed by acylcarnitine profiles, and finally with the elevation of liver enzymes. All abnormal characteristic metabolic indicators in the "Newborn-screen Group " came back to normal levels at earlier ages than the "Clinical diagnosed Group. " c.852_855del (41.2%), IVS16ins3kb (17.6%), c.615 + 5G > A (9.6%), 1638_1660dup (4.4%), and c.1177 + 1G > A (3.7%) accounted for 76.5% of all the mutated SLC25A13 alleles in our population. Conclusion: Argininosuccinate synthesis, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, liver function, and cholestasis were more severely affected in the "Clinical diagnosed Group. " The "Newborn-screen Group " had a better prognosis which highlighted the importance of newborn screening of NICCD.																				2296-889X				AUG 24	2022	9								939837	10.3389/fmolb.2022.939837	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2022.939837								36090036					WOS:000850823700001

Analyses of the energy band structure, density functional theory (DFT) computations and DMPO-ESR spin-trapping experiments demonstrate that the formation of a perfect heterointerface with a staggered alignment of band edges between OCN and In2S3 (IS), owing to their close contact, enables photoexcited carriers to migrate via a Z-scheme route, which can maintain the higher reduction and oxidation capability of electrons and holes, respectively. Furthermore, the Z-scheme OCN/IS heterostructures efficaciously facilitate the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, as demonstrated using PL spectra, transient photocurrent densities and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). These lead to the enhanced photocatalytic activity towards reducing Cr(vi) into Cr(iii). Besides, the integration of OCN with IS can enhance the responsiveness to visible light based on the results of UV-vis DRS, thereby inducing the formation of more electrons and holes,and also contributing to the improvement of the photocatalytic activity for Cr(vi) reduction. In consequence, all the pre-prepared OCN/IS hybrids possess markedly improved photocatalytic activities for Cr(vi) reduction, relative to pure OCN and pristine IS under visible light (lambda > 420 nm) illumination. With the increase in the In(dedc)(3) to OCN mass ratio (R), the photocatalytic activities of these OCN/IS hybrids increase first and then decrease. The sample with an optimum R of 0.9 (OCN/IS-0.9) can remove nearly 100% of Cr(vi) after 40 min of illumination, being superior to most of g-C3N4-based and IS-based photocatalysts. Its reaction rate constant for Cr(vi) photoreduction (0.08947 min(-1)) is 56.7 fold and 8.8 fold higher than that of pure OCN (0.00155 min(-1)) and pristine IS (0.00913 min(-1)), respectively. This work affords a deep understanding on designing preeminent Z-scheme photocatalysts towards the degradation of Cr(vi) under visible-light irradiation.					liu, anyu/KUF-0204-2024; Zou, Zhigang/AFG-8475-2022; Huang, Xinyue/AAB-4867-2021; Hu, Jianqiang/JAC-7657-2023	Li, Yuqin/0009-0002-1185-9796; Hu, Jianqiang/0000-0002-7842-3308													2044-4753	2044-4761				DEC 14	2021	11	24					7963	7972		10.1039/d1cy01866c	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1cy01866c		NOV 2021											WOS:000716553100001

However, the primary limitation for large-scale algae production is the fact that algae requires large amounts of fresh water for cultivation. To address this issue, scientists around the world are working on ways to reuse the water to grow microalgae so that it can be grown in successive cycles without the need for fresh water. Results In this study, we present the results when we cultivate microalgae with cultivation water that is purified and reused. Specifically, we purify the cultivation water using an ultrafiltration membrane (UFM) treatment and investigate how this treatment affects: the biomass and biochemical components of the microalgae; characteristics of microalgae growth inhibitors; the mechanism whereby potential growth inhibitors are secreted (followed using metabolomics analysis); the effect of activated carbon (AC) treatment and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) on the removal of growth inhibitors of Euglena gracilis. Firstly, the results show that E. gracilis can be only cultivated through two growth cycles with water that has been filtered and reused, and the growth of E. gracilis is significantly inhibited when the water is used a third time. Secondly, as the number of reused water cycles increases, the Cl- concentration gradually increases in the cultivation water. When the Cl- concentration accumulates to a level of fivefold higher than that of the control, growth of E. gracilis is inhibited as the osmolality tolerance range is exceeded. Interestingly, the osmolality of the reused water can be reduced by replacing NH4Cl with urea as the source of nitrogen in the cultivation water. Thirdly, E. gracilis secretes humic acid (HA)-which is produced by the metabolic pathways for valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis and by linoleic acid metabolism-into the cultivation water. Because HA contains large fluorescent functional groups, specifically extended pi(pi)-systems containing C=C and C=O groups and aromatic rings, we were able to observe a positive correlation between HA concentration and the rate of inhibition of E. gracilis growth using fluorescence spectroscopy. Moreover, photosynthetic efficiency is adversely interfered by HA, thereby reductions in the synthetic efficiency of paramylon and lipid in E. gracilis. In this way, we are able to confirm that HA is the main growth inhibitor of E. gracilis. Finally, we verify that all the HA is removed or converted into nutrients efficiently by AC or UV/H2O2/O-3 treatments, respectively. As a result of these treatments, growth of E. gracilis is restored (AC treatment) and the amount of biomass is promoted (UV/H2O2/O-3 treatment). Conclusions These studies have important practical and theoretical significance for the cyclic cultivation of E. gracilis and for saving water resources. Our work may also provide a useful reference for other microalgae cultivation.

Different additives were employed to simultaneously reduce NOX emissions and bed agglomeration from the fluidized bed combustion of biomass. The base fuel was straw, and the additives included CaO, kaolin, MgCO3, coal fly ash, clay, (NH4)(2)Fe(SO4)(2), NH4Fe(SO4)(2), (NH4)(2)SO4, NH4MgPO4, AlNH4(SO4)(2), (NH4)(2)HPO4, (NH4)(3)[Fe(C2O4)(3)], and urea. The influence of (NH4)(2)SO4 particle size (<35 and <106 mu m) and introduction method (batch addition or premixing with fuel) was additionally investigated. The most effective additives against NOX emissions and bed agglomeration were further studied in air staged straw combustion and unstaged sunflower husk combustion. During sunflower husk combustion, the influence of ash accumulation and incipient defluidization on NOX emissions were examined. The results show that kaolin, CaO, MgCO3, (NH4)(2)Fe(SO4)(2), NH4Fe(SO4)(2), AlNH4(SO4)(2), and NH4MgPO4 prevented defluidization during straw combustion under the investigated conditions. Of these, AlNH4(SO4)(2) and NH4MgPO4 reduced the fuel-N to NO conversion by 40%. The mechanism of reduction was related to the facilitation of thermal DeNO(X) reactions by the introduction of NH3-releasing additives. However, the NH-based additives resulted in higher emissions of N2O. The size of (NH4)(2)SO4 particles had a slight influence on the defluidization tendency and nitrogen chemistry, while no significant difference was observed between the two additive introduction methods. Air staging reduced the fuel-N to NO conversion by 40% during straw combustion. The use of NH4MgPO4 and AlNH4(SO4)(2) under air staged conditions increased the NO emission slightly. This was predominantly caused by the combustion of NH3 in the secondary air jet. In the case of unstaged sunflower husk combustion, NH4MgPO4 and AlNH4(SO4)(2) prevented defluidization while reducing the conversion of fuel-N to NO by 30%. During sunflower husk combustion, the accumulation of ash increased NO and decreased NH3 concentrations above the bed. This was related to the poor mixing as the bed approached defluidization and to the catalytic effect of ash forming elements on the oxidation of NH3 to NO.

Herein, TiO2 thin flakes modified by g-C3N4 quantum dots (g-C3N4 QDs) were fabricated successfully through a facile thermal treatment of restacked single-layer nanosheets of Ti1.73O41.07- in the presence of urea as a source of g-C3N4 QDs. Characterizations showed that g-C3N4 QDs with a size of similar to 10 nm were homogeneously deposited on the surface of TiO2 thin flakes. Quenching experiments of center dot OH radicals and the detection of radicals by EPR certified the direct Z-scheme heterojunctions between g-C3N4 QDs and TiO2 flakes. The TiO2 nanoflakes/g-C3N4 QDs hybrid exhibited excellent activity for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from a methanol solution and the degradation of RhB due to the enhanced charge separation efficiency and improved light absorption in the direct Z-scheme heterojunctions. This study demonstrates that the rational design of heterojunction is effective for attaining the superior photocatalytic performance.

However, differences in adipose tissue metabolism between these two approaches are unclear. Here, we evaluated the effects of HIIT and MICT on metabolic phenotypes in aged rats. HIIT significantly decreased fat mass, increased percent lean mass, decreased fat-to-lean ratio, reduced serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, increased serum interleukin-10 levels, and decreased perirenal adipose tissue leptin compared with rats in the sedentary (SED) group. HIIT also increased pregnenolone, cortisol, and corticosterone in both adipose tissue and serum. Both exercise modalities enhanced hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase expression compared with the SED group and decreased palmitic acid, stearic acid, octadecadienoic acid, urea, 1-heptadecanol, and alpha-tocopherol. MICT was related to glycerolipid metabolism, whereas HIIT was related to steroid hormone biosynthesis. Overall, HIIT showed more favorable regulation of anti-inflammatory activity than MICT.

The as-prepared sponge-like BN displayed fast adsorption rates and ultrahigh adsorption capacities for gaseous formaldehyde (HCHO), e.g., 19 mg/g in equilibrium with approximately 20 ppm of HCHO in air, which is an order of magnitude higher than those of other tested materials, including commercial hexagonal BN and various metal oxides. The superb HCHO adsorption performance of the porous BN is mainly due to its large specific surface area (627 m(2)/g), as well as the abundant surface hydroxyl and amine groups. Moreover, chemisorption can occur on the BN layers and contribute to the high HCHO uptake capacity via Cannizzaro-type disproportionation reactions, during which HCHO is transformed into less toxic formic acid and methanol. This porous BN is a promising adsorbent for indoor HCHO removal and may serve as the support for highly efficient HCHO decomposition catalysts.

J	Joseph, A; Mathew, A; Thomas, T				Joseph, Anit; Mathew, Arshitha; Thomas, Tiju			Nickel oxynitride: A low overpotential, highly durable bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient water-splitting	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												This study presents a simple soft urea technique for synthesizing nickel-based catalysts, focusing on the transition of NiO to NiON and finally to Ni3N. We conducted a detailed investigation into the catalytic activity of these nickel derivatives, employing techniques such as UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy for thorough characterization. The results reveal that NiON outperforms the standard RuO2 catalyst, NiO and Ni3N, achieving an overpotential of 285 mV with a Tafel slope of 57 mV/dec at 10 mA/cm2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and a remarkable lower overpotential of 129 mV with a Tafel slope of 34 mV/dec for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Notably, NiON demonstrates exceptional stability as a bifunctional catalyst for 14 h. In comparison with oxide (3.47 eV) and nitride phase (2.6 eV), nickel oxynitride possesses a lower optical band gap (2.2 eV). This study provides valuable insights into the roles of nitrogen and oxygen in nickel electrocatalysts, paving the way for enhanced efficiency in overall water splitting applications.

The performance of MFCs with activated graphite as the catalyst-free cathodes was then compared to those with untreated graphite. Results suggested that H3PO4 and HNO3 activations could improved ORR, showing the highest ORR activity in graphite treated with 14.62 M H3PO4 for 12 h at 30-50 degrees C. MFCs with H3PO4 and HNO3 activated graphite cathodes generated maximum power densities (7.9 W/m(3) and 6.5 W/m(3), respectively) 2.4 and 1.8 times higher than that of the untreated control. The chemical activation process involves just a simple immersion step, and it does not require heating, electrochemical process or expensive chemicals. Therefore, it is a highly cost-effective approach to improve the performance of MFCs. We recommend an in-situ modification of graphite cathodes in scale-up MFCs with either H3PO4 or HNO3 to optimize MFCs' various industrial applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a constellation of disturbances caused by unequal blood flow within the shared placenta giving rise to a major hemodynamic imbalance between the twins. Here, we applied TTTS as a model to uncover fetal metabolic adaptations to cardiovascular stress. We compared untargeted metabolomic analyses of amniotic fluid samples from severe TTTS cases vs. singleton controls. Amniotic fluid metabolites demonstrated alterations in fatty acid, glucose, and steroid hormone metabolism in TTTS. Among TTTS cases, unsupervised principal component analysis revealed two distinct clusters of disease defined by levels of glucose metabolites, amino acids, urea, and redox status. Our results suggest that the human fetal heart can adapt to hemodynamic stress by modulating its glucose metabolism and identify potential differences in the ability of individual fetuses to respond to cardiovascular stress.					chen, qy/JXM-3217-2024; Fan, Huihui/AGB-0221-2022; Papanna, Ramesha/J-6395-2019; Parchem, Jacqueline/HDN-4962-2022	Parchem, Jacqueline/0000-0002-4795-3488; Papanna, Ramesha/0000-0002-3801-346X														2589-0042				AUG 18	2023	26	8							107424	10.1016/j.isci.2023.107424	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2023.107424		AUG 2023						37575192					WOS:001053007900001

As pyrolysis temperature increased, ash content, pH, electrical conductivity, surface area, pore volume and aromatic carbon content of biochar increased while yield, ratios of oxygen:carbon and hydrogen: carbon and alkyl carbon content decreased. During incubation, SOC, total N, and ammonium-N contents increased in all biochar-amended treatments compared with the urea treatment; however, soil nitrate-N content first increased and then decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature of the applied biochar. Extracellular enzyme activities associated with carbon transformation first increased and then decreased with biochars pyrolyzed at 450 and 600 degrees C. Protease activity markedly increased with increased pyrolysis temperatures, whereas pyrolysis temperature had limited effect on soil urease activity. The results indicated that the responses of extracellular enzymes to biochar were dependent on the pyrolysis temperature, the enzyme itself and incubation time as well.

In this study, we present the synthesis of an anti-perovskite Co4N architecture in a granular nanowhisker form rooted on three-dimensional nickel foam (Co4N/NF) using a hydrothermal method followed by thermal nitridation with ammonia from urea pyrolysis. The resulting Co4N/NF exhibits exceptional efficiency in degrading pnitrophenol (PNP), achieving a degradation efficiency of 97.8 % and a rate constant of 0.204 min(-1) within 20 min. The unique nanostructure of granular nanowhisker Co4N on NF provides abundant surface sites for activating PMS and enhances mass/electron transport, contributing to its excellent degradation capabilities. Additionally, the Co4N/NF material exhibits outstanding stability, easy separation and recovery features, maintaining a degradation efficiency of 90.2 % within 20 min even after five cycles. This study lays the groundwork for developing advanced anti-perovskite nitrides on a 3D substrate to activate PMS for environmental contaminant remediation.

Herein we synthesized a N, P co-doped carbon foam by direct blowing of glucose in the presence of phytic acid (blowing catalyst) and urea (self-sacrificing template).

Chemoenzymatic Total Synthesis of Natural Products	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH												The total synthesis of structurally complex natural products has challenged and inspired generations of chemists and remains an exciting area of active research. Despite their history as privileged bioactivity-rich scaffolds, the use of natural products in drug discovery has waned. This shift is driven by their relatively low abundance hindering isolation from natural sources and the challenges presented by their synthesis. Recent developments in biocatalysis have resulted in the application of enzymes for the construction of complex molecules. From the inception of the Narayan lab in 2015, we have focused on harnessing the exquisite selectivity of enzymes alongside contemporary small molecule-based approaches to enable concise chemoenzymatic routes to natural products. We have focused on enzymes from various families that perform selective oxidation reactions. For example, we have targeted xyloketal natural products through a strategy that relies on a chemo- and site-selective biocatalytic hydroxylation. Members of the xyloketal family are characterized by polycyclic ketal cores and demonstrate potent neurological activity. We envisioned assembling a representative xyloketal natural product (xyloketal D) involving a biocatalytically generated ortho-quinone methide intermediate. The non-heme iron (NHI) dependent monooxygenase ClaD was used to perform the benzylic hydroxylation of a resorcinol precursor, the product of which can undergo spontaneous loss of water to form an ortho-quinone methide under mild conditions. This intermediate was trapped using a chiral dienophile to complete the total synthesis of xyloketal D. A second class of biocatalytic oxidation that we have employed in synthesis is the hydroxylative dearomatization of resorcinol compounds using flavin-dependent monooxygenases (FDMOs). We anticipated that the catalyst-controlled site- and stereoselectivity of FDMOs would enable the total synthesis of azaphilone natural products. Azaphilones are bioactive compounds characterized by a pyranoquinone bicyclic core and a fully substituted chiral carbon atom. We leveraged the stereodivergent reactivity of FDMOs AzaH and AfoD to achieve the enantioselective synthesis of trichoflectin enantiomers, deflectin 1a, and lunatoic acid. We also leveraged FDMOs to construct tropolone and sorbicillinoid natural products. Tropolones are a structurally diverse class of bioactive molecules characterized by an aromatic cycloheptatriene core bearing an alpha-hydroxyketone moiety. We developed a two-step biocatalytic cascade to the tropolone natural product stipitatic aldehyde using the FDMO TropB and a NHI monooxygenase TropC. The FDMO SorbC obtained from the sorbicillin biosynthetic pathway was used in the concise total synthesis of a urea sorbicillinoid natural product. Our long-standing interest in using enzymes to carry out C-H hydroxylation reactions has also been channeled for the late-stage diversification of complex scaffolds. For example, we have used Rieske oxygenases to hydroxylate the tricyclic core common to paralytic shellfish toxins. The systemic toxicity of these compounds can be reduced by adding hydroxyl and sulfate groups, which improves their properties and potential as therapeutic agents. The enzymes SxtT, GxtA, SxtN, and SxtSUL were used to carry out selective C-H hydroxylation and O-sulfation in saxitoxin and related structures. We conclude this Account with a discussion of existing challenges in biocatalysis and ways we can currently address them.

In the present study, an attempt has been made to assess the therapeutic effects of earthworm extract against myocardial infarction induced by epinephrine injection in rats. Materials and Methods: Myocardial infarction was induced in rats by injecting 2 mg kg(-1) epinephrine subcutaneously daily for 2 days. The rats were split into three groups: Control, MI and MI were given earthworm extract (60 mg kgG1, orally) for 7 days. Results: The treatment with earthworm extract restored ST-segment near normal, improved cardiac troponin T, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total proteins, albumin, creatinine, uric acid, urea, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, reduced glutathione, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase. According to the histological study, the earthworm extract-treated group exhibited remarkable improvement in the studied heart muscles, liver and kidneys in various areas. Conclusion: Earthworm extract possessed a therapeutic effect against epinephrine-induced myocardial infarction. Earthworm extract improves cardiac, liver and renal biomarkers and restores the EEG pattern to its original state. The therapeutic effect of earthworm extract results from its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.

J	Özdemir, P; Yildirim, R				Ozdemir, Pinar; Yildirim, Ramazan			Photocatalytic glycerol reforming on Pt, Au and Cu supported by reduced TiO2 under visible light irradiation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												The commercial feasibility of biodiesel production highly depends on the effective utilization of byproduct glycerol through an environmentally friendly process like photocatalytic reforming. However, the process should be possible under visible light if solar energy is used. In this work, this process was studied over Pt, Au, Au-Cu, and Cu on reduced TiO2 (by NaBH4), which is more effective under visible light than pristine TiO2, for the first time in literature. Au, Au-Cu, and Cu were loaded by deposition precipitation with urea, while Pt was loaded by impregnation. Although the performance under UV-vis and white TiO2 is still higher, the visible light performance of Pt, Au-Cu, and Cu is much better over reduced TiO2 (91, 36, and 27 mmol/h. gcat respectively) than those over pristine TiO2 (9, 14 and 18 mmol/h. gcat respectively). This indicates that reduced TiO2 has the potential for the visible light reforming of glycerol. (c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Firstly, the nickel chloride salt-urea-solvent (H2O. glycerol/H2O and ethylene glycol/H2O) systems were applied to adjust the morphology of Ni(OH)(2) on NF.

In the current study, we used a large-scale integration (LSI)-based amperometric sensor array system, designated Bio-LSI, to perform two-dimensional imaging of light-induced O-2 evolution from spinach leaves. The employed Bio-LSI chip consists of 400 sensor electrodes with a pitch of 250 mu m for fast electrochemical imaging. Spinach leaves were illuminated to varying intensities of white light (400-700 nm) which induced oxygen evolution and subsequent electrochemical images were collected using the Bio-LSI chip. Bio-LSI images clearly showed the dose-dependent effects of the light-induced oxygen release from spinach leaves which was then significantly suppressed in the presence of urea-type herbicide 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU). Our results clearly suggest that light-induced oxygen evolution can be monitored using the chip and suggesting that the Bio-LSI is a promising tool for real-time imaging. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to describe electrochemical imaging of light-induced O-2 evolution using LSI-based amperometric sensors in plants.

The results indicate that more than 90% of the three substituted urea herbicides are degraded within 40 min. The results from ROSs reveal that surface reactions with photoholes and (OH)-O-center dot on the surface of TiO2 make major contributions, and BrO3- and S2O82- effectively promote the degradation rates of three substituted phenylurea herbicides. And then the point charges (PCs), frontier election densities (FEDs) and energies have been employed to predict the chemisorption pattern, reaction active sites and direction of reaction, respectively. With the help of calculated data and indentified degradation intermediates, the degradation pathways can be proposed as cleavage of side chain, substitution of chlorine atom and hydroxylated of parent molecules.

To investigate possible metabolic patterns and potential biomarkers of BD with arthritis, metabolomic profiling of synovial fluid (SF) from 6 patients with BD with arthritis and 18 patients with SNA was performed using gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry in conjunction with univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. A total of 123 metabolites were identified from samples. Orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis showed clear discrimination between BD with arthritis and SNA. A set of 11 metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers for BD using variable importance for projection values and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Compared with SNA, BD with arthritis exhibited relatively high levels of glutamate, valine, citramalate, leucine, methionine sulfoxide, glycerate, phosphate, lysine, isoleucine, urea, and citrulline. There were two markers identified, elevated methionine sulfoxide and citrulline, that were associated with increased oxidative stress, providing a potential link to BD-associated neutrophil hyperactivity. Glutamate, citramalate, and valine were selected and validated as putative biomarkers for BD with arthritis (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 61.1%). This is the first report to present potential biomarkers from SF for discriminating BD with arthritis from SNA. The metabolomics of SF may be helpful in searching for potential biomarkers and elucidating the clinicopathogenesis of BD with arthritis.

Functionalized Fe3O4 as an effective and recyclable nanocatalyst was prepared and characterized using different methods including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The advantage of this work is the easy separation of the nanocatalyst by using an external magnet, recyclability, non-toxicity, versatility and high stability of the catalyst. Also, low reaction times and excellent yields make the present protocol very useful and attractive for the synthesis of the titled products by ultrasonic irradiation. Furthermore, the products were identified using melting points, FT-IR and H-1 NMR, spectroscopic data.					moradian, mohsen/R-3062-2017	oboudatian, hourieh sadat/0000-0002-6257-1736													1040-7278	1572-8862				JAN	2023	34	1					297	309		10.1007/s10876-021-02214-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10876-021-02214-1		JAN 2022											WOS:000743393600001
J	Chen, F; Jiao, PX; Zhao, CX				Chen, Feng; Jiao, Peixin; Zhao, Caixian			Single-Atom Cobalt Decorated P-doped g-C3N4 for Efficient Visible-Light-Driven Water Splitting	CATALYSIS LETTERS												Single-atom photocatalysts exhibit outstanding performance in energy and environmental photocatalysis, due to their exceptional capabilities in enhancing light-harvesting, charge transfer dynamics, and surface reactions. The key to preparing single-atom photocatalysts lies in developing an appropriate metal-support that can prevent aggregation or sintering during synthetic procedures. In this work, a Co(II)-urea complexe in-situ formed in melamine was employed as single-atom Co precursors to synthesize an efficient single-atom Co decorated P doped g-C3N4 (Co/PCN) photocatalyst. The high-angle annular dark field transmission electron microscope (HAADF-TEM) results indicated abundant Co single atoms were immobilized in the g-C3N4 matrix. Under visible-light irradiation, the as-prepared photocatalysts show remarkably enhanced photocatalytic performance. Especially, loaded with 1.5 wt% single atoms Co, the optimized Co/PCN exhibits H-2 evolution of 892.5 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is 33 times higher than that of PCN, and even twice as much as that of Pt-loaded g-C3N4 (Pt/PCN). The enhanced photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the synergistic effect between single-atom Co and P doping, which facilitates efficient light harvesting, charge separation, and migration. It is believed that this study paves a new avenue for developing high-efficiency single-atom photocatalysts.					chen, feng/JNS-6994-2023	chen, feng/0000-0002-6714-5058													1011-372X	1572-879X				JUN	2024	154	6					2579	2589		10.1007/s10562-023-04494-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10562-023-04494-w		NOV 2023											WOS:001101595400001

A biochemical study	ACTA CIRURGICA BRASILEIRA												PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of Otostegia persica (O. persica) extract on renal damage induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in diabetic rats. METHODS: Forty-eight rats were subjected to right nephrectomy; then, they were allocated into six groups: Sham; Diabetic sham; I/R; Diabetic I/R; I/R+O. persica; Diabetic I/R+O. persica. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (200 mg/kg, i.p.). O. persica (300 mg/kg/day, p.o) was administered for 2 weeks. On the 15th day, ischemia was induced in left kidney for 60 min, followed by reperfusion for 24h. Renal functional and biochemical markers were estimated. RESULTS: I/R in both normal and diabetic rats, induced a significant elevation in serum levels of urea and creatinine (p<0.05). Renal I/R induced a significant increase of malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase and nitric oxide concentrations associated with significant reduction in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in comparison with the sham group (p<0.05). Diabetic rats that underwent renal I/R exhibited a significant increase in all the studied parameters with a reduction in the antioxidant enzymes as compared to nondiabetic rats (p<0.05). These deleterious effects associated with renal I/R were improved by the treatment with O. persica (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Otostegia persica pretreatment protected the renal injury from ischemia-reperfusion in diabetic rats.

The nanoparticles are preferably synthesized using a bottom-up approach in liquid as it allows the particle size to be more precisely controlled. In this study, we employed microplasma to synthesize Co3O4 nanoparticles because it eliminates harmful reducing agents and is efficient and cost-effective. Microplasma reactors are equipped with copper wire electrodes to generate plasma and are simple to configure. The product was characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The experimental parameters that were varied for the synthesis were: with or without stirring, with or without indirect ultrasonication, and with or without capping agents (urea and sucrose). The results showed that the microplasma enabled Co3O4 nanoparticles to be successfully synthesized, with particle sizes of 10.9-17.7 nm, depending on the synthesis conditions.					Hossain, Md.

A high-resolution multi-attribute method for product characterization, process characterization, and quality control of therapeutic proteins	ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY												During the manufacturing of therapeutic proteins, Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) have been monitored by conventional methods, such as cation exchange chromatography (CEX), reduced capillary electrophoresis sodium dodecyl sulfate (rCE-SDS), and 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB) labelling method. The conventional methods often generate individual peaks that contain multiple components, which may obscure the detection and the quantification of individual critical quality attributes (CQAs). Alternatively, Multi-Attribute Method (MAM) enables detection and quantification of specific CQAs. A high resolution MAM has been developed and qualified to replace several conventional methods in monitoring product quality attributes, such as oxidation, deamidation, clipping, and glycosylation. The qualified MAM was implemented in process characterization, as well as release and stability assays in quality control (QC). In combination with a design-of experiments (DoE), the MAM method identified multivariate process parameter ranges that yield acceptable CQA level, which provides operational flexibility for manufacturing.

The most promising catalysts are often regarded as noble metals. But maintaining high catalytic performance while reducing the number of noble metals remains a significant difficulty. Here, a 0.6 weight percent (wt%) Ag-based catalyst was used to catalyze the reduction of 4-NP in contaminated water.Methods: Using a one-step urea-glass method and annealing at 380 degrees C, Ni3N-Ni heterostructures were implanted in a carbon matrix, and subsequently Ag nanoparticles were introduced to the Ni3N-Ni@C by galvanically substituting Ni for AgNO3. Spectra in the UV-vis range were employed to track the reduction reaction. In- vestigations were done into how both inorganic and organic species affected catalytic effectiveness.Significant Results: Compared to Ni3N-Ni@C and Ni/Ag (0.6 wt%)@C, Ni3N-Ni/Ag (0.6 wt%)@C displayed good catalytic activity and stability toward 4-NP reduction with a rate constant of 8.1 x 103 s-1 gom. The catalytic efficiency was essentially unaffected by the interferents. The catalyst could quickly purify lake water that was contaminated with very concentrated 4-NP (140 ppm) in about 6 min.																			1876-1070	1876-1089				FEB	2023	143								104708	10.1016/j.jtice.2023.104708	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtice.2023.104708		JAN 2023											WOS:000964186600001

Replacing OER with a thermodynamically favorable reaction is significant to decrease the energy consumption. Coal-assisted water electrolysis (CAWE), with a theoretical potential of only 0.21 V, received special attention. However, the conventional CAWE suffers from poor stability to maintain high current, the continuous collision of coal particles with electrodes and membranes also causes the abrasion of these components. Here, a two-step CAWE system with the electrolysis system (ES) and hydrothermal system (HS) was proposed. The homogeneous ES generates H2 assisted by the anodic Fe2+ oxidation (Fe2+& RARR;Fe3+), while the heterogeneous HS supplies Fe2+ via the reduction of Fe3+ by coal slurry (Fe3+& RARR;Fe2+). Results showed that key operating parameters significantly affected the Fe3+ reduction by coal in HS. Additionally, a homemade continuous proton exchange membrane electrolyzer was used to test the two-step CAWE concept. The current density can achieve 154 mA/cm2 and remain 136 mA/cm2 after 5 cycles, at a low cell voltage of 1.2 V, corresponding to a low power consumption of 2.87 kWh/Nm3(H2).

Thermodynamic investigation of hydrogen enrichment and carbon suppression using chemical additives in ethanol dry reforming	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												In this study, a thermodynamic equilibrium analysis has been performed on ethanol dry reforming in presence of commonly used reducing agents such as glycine, hydrazine, urea and ammonia. The effect of these agents on hydrogen enrichment and carbon suppression has been investigated at one atmospheric pressure and 300 K-1200 K temperature. Among the investigated additives, hydrazine was found to be the most suitable for maximizing hydrogen production and removing elemental carbon formation. This study was further extended to ethanol steam reforming and similar conclusions were obtained. Industrial significance of this study is associated with reforming reactions where catalyst deactivation due to coking is a major problem. Based on the results obtained, addition of suitable chemical additives in the feed could alleviate this problem to a significant level and help in improving catalyst life cycle.

A bimodal porous alumina support was prepared via the evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method, and the nickel nanoparticles (5 wt.%) on bimodal alumina was synthesized using four different synthesis methods such as freeze drying, wet impregnation, urea deposition-precipitation, and chemical vapor deposition method. The reactivity of nickel nanoparticles was evaluated for CO2 reforming with methane, concerning the CO2 and CH4 conversion as well as the H-2 to CO ratio of the produced syngas. The catalysts were thoroughly characterized before and after the reaction using different techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 sorption analysis, H-2-temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), H-2-temperature programmed desorption (H-2-TPD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Characterization of various catalysts revealed that variation of synthesis procedure affects the metal-support interface and the type of nickel species present on the gamma-alumina support, as well as the textural properties of the catalysts. The catalytic behavior was entirely different for each of the as developed metal-support interface, derived in by the use of different synthesis procedures. The catalyst prepared by urea deposition-precipitation method was found to be most active and stable at 700 degrees C and latm for a period of a 100h run of time on stream with diluted gas feed and even without the dilution of feed gas for next 25h of the run. Comparing with bimodal catalyst, a unimodal catalyst with same metal loading exhibited the inferior catalytic activity and stability. The results of the comparative study showed that the stable catalytic performance of the bimodal structured catalyst is due to the combined effect of the type of metal-support interface of the catalyst, smaller size of nickel particle and bimodal structure of support material. The bimodal pore character of catalyst support has shown to prevent, Ni particles from sintering during the reaction and hence, better catalytic performance and resistance to coking.					shah, mumtaj/ABA-9811-2021; Shah, Mumtaj/JCE-7112-2023	Shah, Mumtaj/0000-0002-8544-6946; Das, Subhasis/0000-0001-9905-7362													0926-860X	1873-3875				APR 25	2018	556						137	154		10.1016/j.apcata.2018.01.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apcata.2018.01.007													WOS:000430780000015

NiO nanoparticles decorated at Nile blue-modified reduced graphene oxide, new powerful electrocatalysts for water splitting	JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												New nanocomposites, containing nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiONPs) and Nile blue@reduced graphene oxide (NB/rGO), were synthesized. Nile blue was decorated on the surface of rGO by covalent bonds (using diazonium reaction). Then, NiONPs was immobilized on the surface of the functionalized rGO. The electrocatalytic and electrochemical behaviors of NiO@rGO and NiO@Nile/rGO nanocomposites for HER were investigated using cyclic voltanunetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in acidic and alkaline media. From them, NiO@rGO has shown long-term stability for HER in acidic solution at room temperature. The electrocatalytic activity of NiO@rGO (vs. NiO@Nile/rGO) for HER was greatly improved and its behavior was close to the behavior of platinum. In the next stage of our study, due to the importance of oxygen as an energy source, the production of oxygen molecules through electrochemical oxidation of water at NiO@rGO and NiO@Nile/rGO were studied too. For this purpose, the electrochemical behaviors of the nanocomposites for oxygen evolution reaction were investigated using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in acidic and alkaline media. The results of them confirmed that NiO@Nile/rGO acts as an excellent electrocatalyst with good long-term stability for oxygen evolution reaction in 0.5 mol L-1 KOH solution at room temperature. Therefore, NiO@rGO and NiO@Nile/rGO can be used as powerful cathode and anode, respectively in an electrochemical cell for water splitting.

Heteroatom-doped graphene aerogels and carbon-magnetite catalysts for the heterogeneous electro-Fenton degradation of acetaminophen in aqueous solution	JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS												Nitrogen (N) and nitrogen/sulphur (N/S) co-doped graphene aerogels were synthesized by hydrothermal method using graphene oxide and urea or thiourea as precursors following a freezing-drying process. The determination of the number of the electrons involved in the mechanism of electro-reduction of oxygen (ORR) in alkaline medium was assessed. The mechanism of 4e(-) was obtained with N/S-doped graphene aerogels showing good electrocatalytic behavior and larger kinetic current densities. The 2e(-) ORR process (involving in situ H2O2 generation) was mainly obtained using N-doped graphene aerogels and it was related to the content of N functionalities as well as to the porous texture of the samples. Carbon-magnetic catalyst was synthesized to promote the decomposition of H2O2 to HO for the degradation of acetaminophen (ACE) in heterogeneous electro-Fenton (EF) process. The highest pollutant removal (71.0%) and mineralization (51.6%) were obtained with N-doped materials and carbon-Fe3O4 catalyst, showing good stability and low iron leaching (0.33 mg L-1).

Urea and copper sulfate pentahydrate were used as sources of doping element for Cu/N-codoped TiO2, respectively. The characterizations of the nanoparticles were done by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra. XRD revealed that all the nanoparticles were indexed to the anatase phase structure, with crystallite size range from 11 to 30 nm, which decreased with the doping of copper and nitrogen. The photocatalytic activities of Cu/N-codoped TiO2 showed the highest activities than other TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 and N-doped TiO2). The photodegradation efficiency of Cu/N-codoped TiO2 on phenanthrene under visible light irradiation was slightly higher (96%) comparing to UV light irradiation (94%). Cu/N-codoped TiO2 was found to be very efficient and economical for phenanthrene removal, because the smallest amount of Cu/N-codoped TiO2 exhibited the best removal efficiency on phenanthrene.

The obtained nanocomposites were characterized by using XRD, TEM, BET, XPS and UV-vis techniques. The results revealed that the chemical and morphological properties of the nanocomposites were significantly dependent on the nitrogen source. The interstitial N doping occurred in the form of N-O-Ti-O and the surfaces of the samples were modified by carbon species from dopants. As compared to that of the undoped sample, N-doped samples exhibited a red shift in the band gap transition. The results of simulated solar light photocatalytic activities demonstrated that NTS-EDA exhibited better photocatalytic activity than singly Ndoped (i.e., no carbon) or undoped TiO2/Sep sample. The enhanced solar-light activity is attributed to the low band gap energy with N-doping, the high adsorption capacity and uniform distribution of titania nanoparticles with sepiolite as support, and the appropriate carbon content of the dopants.																			0169-1317	1872-9053				DEC 15	2018	166						9	17		10.1016/j.clay.2018.08.025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clay.2018.08.025													WOS:000449135300002

The structure, morphology, photoluminescence and photocatalytic properties of the as-prepared Au@Y2O3:Eu3+ microspheres were subsequently investigated. The results indicate that the Y2O3:Eu3+ microspheres can be well indexed to the cubic Y2O3 phase. Furthermore, the Au@Y2O3:Eu3+ microsphere is able to maintain the spherical morphology and good dispersion of the carbon sphere template. The yolk-shell Au@Y2O3: Eu3+ spheres exhibit the bright luminescence of Eu3+. The photocatalysis of the Y2O3:Eu3+ shell and the Au core occur simultaneously, thereby significantly decreasing the absorbance of rhodamine B solutions. This work provides a strategy for inhibiting aggregation of noble metal nanoparticles during high-temperature calcinations and leaching of noble metal nanoparticles into a solution through a mesoporous shell. Ultimately, a multifunctional nanostructure was obtained by combining a specific metal core with an oxide shell. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, ureaassisted synthesis strategy was designed for ceria-zirconia-praseodymia catalyst (CeZrPrOx) to create lattice defects; its effects on catalyst structure, physical-chemical properties and catalytic diesel soot purification activity were systematically investigated. Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) findings indicate that the urea-assisted synthesized catalyst (CeZrPrOx-U) has remarkably more Ce3+ proportion (structure defects), oxygen vacancies and surface reactive oxygen species (O22- and O2-). Temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR) and temperature-programmed desorption by oxygen (O2-TPD) results further prove that the oxygen migration of the CeZrPrOx-U is definitely enhanced. Compared to the conventional CeZrPrOx catalyst, the bulk lattice oxygen of the CeZrPrOx-U can be migrated to the surface to generate surface reactive oxygen species more easily. As a consequence, the prepared CeZrPrOx-U catalyst exhibits obviously better catalytic diesel soot purification activity. Therefore, this study suggests that engineering the structure defects in CeZrPrOx catalyst is an effective approach to improve physical-chemical properties and enhance the soot catalytic elimination activity of the catalyst.

J	Xie, L; Jiang, GZ; Qian, F				Xie, Lu; Jiang, Guozhang; Qian, Feng			Experimental Research on Aftertreatment SCR Sizing Strategy for a Nonroad Mid-Range Diesel Engine	ENERGIES												Urea-Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is widely used to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. This paper presents a comprehensive experimental research work on aftertreatment emissions of NOx and ammonia (NH3) slip for three aftertreatment concepts by introducing the SCR sizing strategy on a 6-cylinder mid-range non-exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) diesel engine to meet China non-road Stage IV regulation limits. It can be observed that the three concepts could meet the regulation limits for NOx emissions and NH(3)slip by selecting the appropriate length. There is little effect on emission results during a non-road transient cycle (NRTC) when the aftertreatment inlet/outlet with insulation and without insulation and the emission results on both strategies could meet non-road China Stage IV regulation limits. It is recommended to select Concept 2 which could meet regulation requirements considering multiple factors in the SCR sizing strategy. Substrate impact and NH3/NOx molar ratio (ANR) impact are investigated based on Concept 2. The results show that by applying the SCR substrate aftertreatment with a cell density of 600 cpsi, NOx conversion capability is stronger than that with cell density 400 cpsi for the same SCR size. Current dosing strategy is capable and recommended ANR is 0.9-1.1 if considering dosing strategy optimization. The methodology in this study provides an effective guidance and reference for future aftertreatment SCR sizing strategies in real applications.																				1996-1073				SEP	2020	13	17							4462	10.3390/en13174462	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13174462													WOS:000569643600001

Considering the nutrient loss of 50-70% to the environment during soil management, enhanced efficiency fertilizers have been an alternative to mitigate this problem. We used cellulose nanofibril (CNF) biopolymer to modify with negative (oxidation mediated by 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine1-oxyl), and positive charges (etherization by 2,3-epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride) their surface. The modified CNF suspensions were defibrillated by ultrasonication and inserted (NH4)2HPO4 in equimolar proportions according to the surface charges. Finally, CNF/fertilizer suspensions were spray-dried to obtain the microsphere-shaped material. Thermal, structural, and morphological characterizations showed that (I) the CNF surface modifications were effective, (II) the ultrasonication order does not change the anionic CNF microsphere properties, and (III) doubling the amount of salt in the cationic CNF microspheres affects thermal and nutrient release properties.

Exciting developments are reported for nanoscale redox cycling devices, which can chemically amplify signal readout. We also discuss promising high-frequency techniques such as nanocapacitive CMOS sensor arrays or heterodyning. In addition, we review electrochemical microreactors for use in (drug) synthesis, biocatalysis, water treatment, or to electrochemically degrade urea for use in a portable artificial kidney. Electrochemical microreactors are also used in combination with mass spectrometry, e.g., to study the mimicry of drug metabolism or to allow electrochemical protein digestion. The review concludes with an outlook on future perspectives in both nanoscale electrochemical sensing and electrochemical microreactors. For sensors, we see a future in wearables and the Internet of Things. In microreactors, a future goal is to monitor the electrochemical conversions more precisely or ultimately in situ by combining other spectroscopic techniques.					van den Berg, Albert/B-4648-2013; Odijk, Mathieu/I-5880-2012	Odijk, Mathieu/0000-0002-4467-9604													1936-1327						2018	11						421	440		10.1146/annurev-anchem-061417-125642	http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-anchem-061417-125642								29517917					WOS:000435534100019

The anode and electrolyte (Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta, (SDC20)) materials are synthesized using urea combustion method. The desired phase formed is confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The textural study is performed using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. STDC shows nearly 4 times enhancement in surface area and higher mesopores compared with SDC20. The effect of titanium on chemical environment of cerium is investigated using Xray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Both + 3 and + 4 valence states of cerium exist, which indicate high oxygen non-stoichiometry present in the synthesized samples. The morphological features are investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy/High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy. Electrolyte supported cell is fabricated using cold-pressing and spin coating of electrode and co-firing of cell.

However, traditional production methods show high chemical and energy consumption, while the obtained PCNFs have lower charge density. In this study, PCNFs with higher charge density (2.09-3.79 mmol.g(-1)) were produced by tuning heat soaking pretreatment of cellulose fibers in phosphate salt and urea solutions, followed by curing and mechanical fibrillation. An optimized pretreatment can be achieved by heat-assisted soaking at 80 degrees C for 25 min, which was effective to produce PCNFs with greater performance (e.g., higher charge and crystallinity) compared to those of traditional methods. Furthermore, the optimized route is more sustainable with a substantial decrease in resource consumption including chemicals (33.6%), water (55.8%), and energy (65.3%), and the production costs would be saved by 62.0% in comparison with the traditional route. Such a sustainable and economic process has great potential in the industrial production of PCNFs.					chen, shaohuang/GYE-1008-2022; Qi, Wei/I-2550-2018; He, Zhimin/KYQ-2126-2024; Su, Rongxin/AAA-7967-2021; Rongxin, Su/B-6634-2014; Huang, Renliang/C-2037-2013	Chen, Shaohuang/0000-0002-5274-9190; Rongxin, Su/0000-0001-9778-9113; Huang, Renliang/0000-0003-0797-3473; Cui, Mei/0000-0003-2304-3903													2168-0485					JUL 11	2022	10	27					8876	8884		10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c01904	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c01904		JUN 2022											WOS:000885893300001

The support systems were prepared by simple precipitation technique and the gold supported samples were synthesized using modified deposition-precipitation with urea method. The physicochemical characterization was performed by XRD, UV-Vis DRS, BET surface area, ICP-AES, TEM and XPS techniques. The catalytic performance of the synthesized catalysts were measured spectrophotometrically by engaging them for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol in presence of NaBH4 serving as a hydrogen source. Au/CeO2-TiO2 has been found to be a very effective catalyst showing similar to 100 % conversion in short reaction time. The catalytic activity of the Au/CeO2-TiO2 showed no significant difference even after recycling the catalyst for four times indicating a promising potential for industrial application.

However, GCN suffers from limited light- absorption capacity and rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Herein, a new kind of photo- catalyst based on GCN has been synthesized by introducing a small molecule compound (maleamide) through a facile thermal polycondensation method (550 degree celsius for 180 min) and applied it to photocatalytic removal of bisphenol A (BPA). The optimized GCN-20 (20 mg maleamide in 10 g urea) exhibits the best BPA degradation performance and good stability. The UV-vis test shows that the introduction of maleamide broadens the optical response threshold of GCN from 435 nm to 460 nm. The promoted photocatalytic performance is mainly attributed to enhanced donor-acceptor structure by electron-withdrawing group, which accelerates charge separation and inhibits recombination of free holes and electrons. The active species including superoxide radicals (center dot O2- center dot O 2- ), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 2 O 2 ) and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), center dot OH), play dominant roles in the photocatalytic degradation process.					sun, wei/JAO-0334-2023														0925-8388	1873-4669				NOV 15	2024	1005								176067	10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.176067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.176067		AUG 2024											WOS:001301500200001

A series of V doped graphitic carbon nitride composites (V-g-C3N4) were synthesized via a combination of thermal polymerization of urea and thermal decomposition of NH4VO3. After doping VOx species, the V doped g-C3N4 catalysts achieved an optimal propylene yield of 16.16% with a propylene selectivity of 68.6% at 600 degrees C, compared with undoped g-C3N4 (a propylene yield of 5.42% with a propylene selectivity of 53.9%) at the same condition. Subsequently, various characterization techniques, including XRD, TEM, FTIR, Raman, XPS, N-2 adsorption-desorption, etc., were unitized to investigate the chemical properties and crystalline structures of the prepared catalysts. The essence of catalytic enhancement, such as crystallinity, the main active VOx species, and the newly emerging V-N bonds in V-g-C3N4 catalysts, has been discussed, providing a tentative reaction pathway for CH3(*CH)CH3 and CH3CHCH2* species on V active sites.

However, the adsorption and activation mechanisms of CO2 on TiO2, the most used photocatalyst, are poorly understood and investigated. Gold nanoparticles were prepared by a modified deposition-precipitation method using urea and a chemical reductant. Bare P25 was used as reference. Combined spectroscopic investigations of fresh and spent samples with photoactivity studies reported in this article provide new insights to the role of CO2 adsorption and carbonate formation on Au/TiO2 during CO2 photocatalytic reduction. The key intermediates' and products' adsorption (CO, methanol, ethanol) was studied, coupled with X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS) and UV-Visible spectroscopy. The adsorption of CO2 on fresh and spent catalysts changes radically considering the carbonate formation and the gold surface presence. Methanol and ethanol revealed new adsorbed species on Au with respect to bare titania. The characterisation of the spent catalysts revealed the good stability of these samples.

Betanin was extracted from the fruits of Hylocereus ocamponis, and its effects were evaluated in a mice model for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Six-week-old male BALB/c mice fed with a high-fat diet received 9.6 mg of betanin per day during 40 days. Body, liver, and epididymal fat pad weights and the levels of blood serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins, alanine aminotransferase, blood nitrogen urea, ereatinine, and total antioxidant capacity were measured. Hepatosteatosis and inflammatory infiltration were categorized, and the relative cell area of hepatocytes was determined.

Two different methods were used to modify fibers: NaOH + urea and TEMPO ((2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxidanyl) and blended with traditional paper fibers. Subsequently, we evaluated the resulting sheets for their optical, strength, and thermo-mechanical characteristics. Notably, we also scrutinized sheets created exclusively with 100% TEMPO-modified fibers. The addition of modified fibers led to improvements in several strength properties, but it had a noteworthy negative impact on the optical properties of TEMPO-treated fibers compared to the other papers. Furthermore, thermal analysis revealed that the contraction rates of the samples increased considerably up to 40-50 degrees C for the out-of-plane direction and surpassed 130 degrees C for the in-plane direction. In general, the inclusion of modified fibers had a significant effect on thermo-mechanical properties. Specifically, TEMPO modification resulted in an increase in the maximum in-plane contraction ratio, shifting it from -0.40% to -0.59%, along with its corresponding temperature. This research underscores the potential of modified fibers to enhance paper properties and contribute to the development of more sustainable paper-based products.					; Atik, Celil/A-9736-2018	Oven, Primoz/0000-0001-8151-3817; Atik, Celil/0000-0002-3363-6772														1999-4907				NOV	2023	14	11							2150	10.3390/f14112150	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f14112150													WOS:001107891400001

In this work, engineering of 2D ultrathin and O doping into g-C3N4 was achieved by using thermal gas shocking effect induced via endogenous gases from the urea solution and C/N-steam reforming reaction. The experimental results revealed that the optimal sample exhibited the photo-degradation rates of tetracycline (TC) within 2 h were 87.2%, and the photocatalytic H(2 )evolution rate reached 6.21 mmol h(-1) g(-1). This overwhelming photocatalytic performance is attributed to following factors, including ultrathin thickness results in reduced charge transfer distance, larger specific surface area exposed more active reaction sites, and O doping forms electron-rich centers to promote carrier separation and negative shift of the conduction band for enhanced the reduction potential of photogenerated electrons. This study presents an effective strategy for preparing high active g-C3N4 photocatalysts with optimized modification.					li, lingling/HTR-2760-2023; Shi, Weilong/JFS-7013-2023; GUO, FENG/JRX-3555-2023; Shi, Yuxing/JEF-9787-2023	Shi, Weilong/0000-0002-4762-5599; Guo, Feng/0000-0002-3555-4543													1383-5866	1873-3794				JUL 1	2022	292								121038	10.1016/j.seppur.2022.121038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2022.121038		APR 2022											WOS:000805959100006

In this work, we develop a facile one-step coupling cold plasma and thermal polymerization approach to synthesize a series of nitrogen defect-rich graphitic carbon nitrides (C3N4-x), which are used for visible-light-driven hydrogen generation from water. The nitrogen defect-induced band structure regulation of C3N4-x catalysts can be carried out through controlling the bombardment time and excitation power of generator during the plasma modification process. The defective C3N4-x catalysts have the extended visible light absorption and improved separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers, which results in the boosted hydrogen generation activity. Particularly, the optimal C3N4-x possesses a hydrogen generation rate of 2.46 mmol h(-1) g(-1) which is about 4.5 times higher than the pristine C3N4 synthesized by the single thermal polymerization of urea. The cold plasma modification-based one-step synthesis approach guides us for rationally designing defective nanomaterials with excellent catalytic performance.

Here, we present a novel approach via combination of waste newspaper (WNP) powder, oxidized glutinous rice starch, and polyamidoamine-epichlorohydrin (PAE) to prepare a formaldehyde-free starch-cellulosic adhesive (SCA) for woody composites. The oxidation treatment made the carboxyl/carbonyl groups more available in starch. Plywood bonded by the optimum SCA with 50 wt% of the WNP powder showed a wet shear strength of 0.83 MPa exceeding that of the oxidized starch adhesive by 130.5 %. During the curing process of SCA, the oxidized starch and WNP fiber participated into the crosslinking reaction with PAE via ester and ether bonds, as evidenced by FTIR analysis. The resulting cured adhesive had enhanced crystalline structures, thermal properties, hydrophobicity, wet-cohesion, rheological properties, and adhesiveness to wood. The SCA showed great potential in wood composites as an alternative to formaldehyde-derived adhesives.

The inhibitor is a urea-based polymer and acts as atypical leveler (Levi). The investigation of the adsorption and coadsorption behavior was experimentally done by galvanostatic and potentiostatic injection experiments. The Levl and SPS components are both necessary for the temporary potential instability, whereas chloride ions, typical suppressor molecules like PEG 3000 (polyethylene glycol 3000) as well as convection have an influence on the frequency of oscillations and the current range in which oscillations appear, but are not necessarily prerequisite for it. A mathematical model, which describes the preconditions for the occurrence of instabilities, is introduced. The model based on variable potential dependent activities of both the inhibiting leveler (Levi) and the accelerator component SPS. Potential dependent decomposition rate of the additives is thereby a side effect. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

These prepared catalyst samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N-2 adsorption, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy (UV-vis), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence (PL) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The photocatalytic activity of the WO3/g-C3N4 composites was evaluated by the photo-degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light irradiation. The results indicated that the composites with 25"wt.% WO3 content exhibited highest photocatalytic activity compared to pure WO3, bare g-C3N4 and other WO3/g-C3N4 composites. The favorable photocatalytic activity of WO3/g-C3N4 composites was mainly attributed to the excellent surface properties, enhanced visible-light absorption and the desirable band positions. A possible Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism was proposed based on structure and electrochemical characterizations results, which can well explain the enhanced migration rate of photogenerated electrons and holes in WO3/g-C3N4 heterojunctions.

Herein, a rapid and low-cost electrochemical sensor for the analysis of NFZ is reported. The method uses Ag-modified electrodes in which different surfactants, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide and sodium dodecyl sulfate, in a ternary choline chloride-urea-glycerol deep eutectic solvent were deposited. The physical properties of the solutions with various surfactants are investigated by a conductivity meter, viscometer, and tensiometer. The morphologies and crystallinity of the Ag-modified electrodes were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and CV analyses indicate that the as-prepared Ag-SDS electrode exhibited better performance as a NFZ sensor. The dynamic linear range of NFZ is 0.66-930 mu M with a corresponding detection limit of 0.37 mu M. The proposed electrochemical sensor was applied to detect NFZ in the aquaculture water sample, and the results showed good recovery in the range from 100.28 to 102.65%.

The experiments of photocatalytic activity indicate that Zn2Ce nanoparticles exhibit excellent photocatalytic performance in the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). 95% of 2,4-DCP molecules were decomposed by Zn2Ce in 240 min. The better photocatalytic degradation ability of Zn2Ce compared to ZnCe, ZnCe2 or single component ZnO and CeO2 nanoparticles is attributed to the improved separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.

A major risk factor for this sector is slow growth rates experienced during farming. Abalone feeds are often supplemented with amino acids in an attempt to enhance abalone growth. This is a first investigation of the effect of added proline to standard abalone feed, on the metabolite profile of slow-growing abalone. A targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics research approach was followed to recognise the metabolic response of abalone showing slower growth performance. The addition of proline to the standard abalone diet was found to serve as a substrate for amino acid catabolism in slower growing abalone, by means of proline breakdown to assist with energy production via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Other amino acids and urea cycle intermediates, that is, arginine, asparagine, ornithine and creatine further support energy production via the action of protein catabolism in slow-growing abalone. Additionally, the importance of understanding how abalone respond metabolically to modified feed highlights the use of metabolomics to answer abalone aquaculture farming questions.

This protocol involved modification of an inexpensive "solution phase combustion" process used for production of nitrogen and fluorine codoped TiO2 photocatalysts. Fluorine-free TiOxNy particles were successfully supported on carbon by adding the carbon support to the precursor dispersion containing titanium tetrafluoride and urea with stirring at 523 K, followed by pyrolysis under N-2 gas as a modification of the photocatalyst synthesis. The catalyst activity depended on the pyrolysis temperature, where the optimal activity was achieved by pyrolysis at 1073-1123 K. The active sites are proposed to be rutile TiO2 doped with nitrogen atoms containing oxygen defects. The developed synthesis route requires less than half of the time required for our previous protocol utilizing two-step pyrolysis under a mixture of H-2/O-2/N-2 gas and NH3-gas and is also significantly more economical.

In addition to its wide acceptance in conventional reactions such as hydrolysis, transesterification, and enantiopure synthesis (kinetic resolution and dynamic kinetic resolution) several reports on the catalytic promiscuity of lipases have also been published. The concept of promiscuity, where lipase catalyzes reactions beyond its natural function, has been perceived as a useful phenomenon which can enhance the utility of lipase as a biocatalyst. Many useful organic reactions such as Aldol condensation, Hantzsch reaction, Canizzaro reaction, Mannich reaction, Baylis-Hillman reaction, Knoevenagel condensation, Michael addition, Ugi reaction, and oxidation catalyzed by lipases have surfaced in the literature.

Light-driven LFFC with a CdS@TiO2 photo-anode achieved a maximal power density (P-max) of 1.2 mW/cm(2) at room temperature, while heat-driven LFFC made a P-max of 142.7 mW/cm(2) at 90 degrees C. About 80% overall efficiency of haze-to-electricity was obtained. Various wastes including different sugars, lignin, cellulose, urea and even the coal-burning power plant ashes could be converted to electricity, indicating the promising prospect of this technology for application in treatment of organic pollutants coupled with generation of electricity.

Potential for forage diet manipulation in New Zealand pasture ecosystems to mitigate ruminant urine derived N2O emissions: a review	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils account for more than 10% of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock urine deposition drives N2O losses from these soils. It has been speculated that non-urea nitrogen compounds (UNCs) in ruminant urine could reduce or inhibit urine patch N2O emissions. However, we hypothesise that UNCs will have no effect on N2O emissions due to their potentially rapid degradation by plants and soil microbes. Our review suggests that plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) are more likely to perform a role in reducing N2O emissions since many PSMs have known antimicrobial properties. Aucubin, found in Plantago, and isothiocyanates, found in Brassica, have been shown to inhibit a key step in N2O production. Future studies should explore this promising research gap by evaluating forages for potential inhibitory PSMs, assessing whether PSMs are excreted in urine after consumption, and determine whether excretal PSM concentrations are sufficient to reduce N2O emissions.

Herein, a surface-modified g-C3N4 was synthesized by the co-condensation of urea + thiourea and 2-methyl imidazole. Physicochemical characterizations reveal that O and C are co-doped, as evident by the XPS and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The light absorption edge is red shifted, lifetimes of the charge carriers, and electron injection efficiencies are ameliorated appropriately. Photocatalysts are employed in the CO2 reduction (from TEOA dissolved water + CO2 gas mixture) and H2O2 production (from pure H2O and O-2 in absence of any organic electron/proton donor) without involving any cocatalyst. CO2-adsorption/TPD measurements support the higher CO2 uptake and lower adsorption energy after the surface modification as confirmed from DFT calculation. Mott-Schottky and VBXPS confirm that C, O co-doping bring required thermodynamic potential that facilitates the CO2/CH3OH and O-2/H2O2 reactions.

Zinc and Lead Leaching from Sphalerite-Galena Concentrate Using Deep Eutectic Solvents Based on Choline Chloride: Effect of Roasting and Iodine as Oxidizing Agent	MOLECULES												The traditional metallurgical routes for producing lead and zinc from primary sources have a significant environmental footprint. Thus, using less pollutant solvents, such as deep eutectic solvents (DESs), would offer a greener solution in metal extraction. This study explores the use of three DESs based on choline chloride (ChCl) (1:2 ChCl-urea, 1:2 ChCl-ethylene glycol, and 1:2 ChCl-glycerol) for recovering Zn and Pb from a sphalerite-galena concentrate of the mining region in Ecuador. Leaching tests of the concentrate (untreated and roasted at 600 degrees C) in each DES were conducted (30 degrees C-24 h). The effect of adding iodine as an oxidizing agent was also evaluated. Recoveries of 2% (Zn) and 14% (Pb) were reported when leaching the untreated concentrate with DES. These recovery values increased to 11% (Zn) and 99% (Pb) after adding iodine during the leaching of the untreated concentrate. Roasting had a similar effect on leaching, increasing the recovery values of Zn (75%) and Pb (90%). Combining roasting as a pretreatment and iodine as an oxidizing agent produced higher Zn recoveries (99%) and Pb (99%). These results were compared to recoveries in acid leaching (H2SO4 and HNO3), revealing the potential of DESs as an alternative for metal recovery from primary sources.

The structural characterization of the novel compounds was performed by a combination of instrumental methods. The electrochemical and in-situ spectroelectrochemical responses of the compounds were recorded and redox properties were illuminated. Graphitic carbon nitride(g-C3N4) was synthesized by thermal decomposition of urea and combined with metallophthalocyanines to avoid agglomeration of phthalocyanine, to obtain homogeneous microstructured catalyst and to provide synergistic effects between pyridinic N-metal bonds of g-C3N4 and metallophthalocyanines (MPcs). The synthesized compounds were electropolymerized onto g-C3N4 thanks to piperazin substitute groups. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of g-C3N4/Poly-MPcs was investigated in alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH). The g-C3N4/Poly-NiPc exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance with low overpotential and Tafel slope, respectively, 380 mV@ 10 mA cm(-2) and 80 mVdec(-1), which is superior to the g-C3N4. Moreover, g-C3N4/Poly-NiPc electrocatalyst exhibited similar to 100 times higher current density than g-C3N4.

Formation of highly crystalline CNC with average particle dimensions 20 x 100 x 700 nm was confirmed with SEM and AFM. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the hydrogen bond interactions of the cellulose hydroxyl groups with the urea C=O group and with the chloride ions were the key factors of the destruction of MCC particles in the process of solvation. The type of cellulose crystal structure (I-beta) and the high degree of crystallinity (about 80% according to Segal method) were preserved during treatment with DES. The ability of the prepared CNC to act as a reinforcing filler was tested by introduction of them into the chitosan-based films plasticized with DES. It was found that addition of 2 wt% of CNC led to an increase in the strength of the films from 11.4 up to 20.4 MPa with a simultaneous increase in the elongation at break.

Benefit from the radial conical channels, the dispersion of copper nanoparticles and the interaction between copper and support were greatly improved. As a result, the Cu/KCC-U catalyst owned plenty of highly dispersed Cu nanoparticles (4.10 nm), and the Cu+ ratio reached 77.38 %. The urchin-like spherical Cu/KCC-U catalyst, arising from the synergy of highly dispersed active copper species with 77.38 % Cu+ ratio and radial conical channel structure, demonstrated superior catalytic hydroge-nation capacity, higher ethanol selectivity, and lower by-product selectivity when compared with reference Cu/ KCC-I and Cu/SiO2-U catalysts. More crucially, the intimate interaction between copper species and KCC-1 support fibers enables the stable presence of Cu+ species in the hydrogenation reaction, resulting in the ultra-high stability of the catalyst. This urchin-like Cu/KCC-U provided a new perspective for designing and devel-oping efficient hydrogenation catalysts with great selectivity and stability.

In this study, two strains of bacteria, SCE2 and NMYGYB4, have been isolated from oilfield slickwater and identified as Tistrella bauzanensis (SCE2) and Brucella sp. (NMYGYB4). The optimal biodegradation conditions of Tistrella bauzanensis SCE2 were inoculation time 36 h, shaking speed 175 rpm, inoculum amount 3% (v/v), pH 3.0, and incubation temperature 37 degrees C with urea and glucose as the nitrogen and carbon sources. And the optimal biodegradation conditions of Brucella sp. NMYGYB4 were 12 h, 185 rpm, 2% (v/ v), pH 7.0 and 37 degrees C with yeast powder and sucrose as the nitrogen carbon sources. HPAM removal rate of Tistrella bauzanensis SCE2 and Brucella sp. NMYGYB4 reached 75.3% and 63.59% at optimal conditions. The degraded samples were analyzed with GPC, FTIR, 1H NMR and HPLC. The results showed that HPAM was broken into small fragments, and amide group has been converted into carboxyl group, and no toxic acrylamide monomer was produced. The specific activities of extracellular amidases of Tistrella bauzanensis SCE2 and Brucella sp. NMYGYB4 were 5.31 U/mg and 4.79 U/mg, respectively. This work will provide novel bacteria strains for HPAM-containing wastewater treatment.

J	Jing, J; Li, LM; Chu, W; Wei, YH; Jiang, CF				Jing, Jiang; Li, Luming; Chu, Wei; Wei, Yahui; Jiang, Chengfa			Microwave-assisted synthesis of high performance copper-based catalysts for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												High performance copper-based catalysts (CuNiZnO/gamma-Al2O3) for hydrogen production from methanol decomposition were successfully synthesized by the method of microwave-assisted thermal hydrolysis of urea. The ICP-OES, N-2 adsorption-desorption, SEM, TEM, XRD and H-2-TPR were applied to characterize the physicochemical properties of the prepared materials. These experiment results reveal that the higher thermal treatment temperature can improve the catalytic performance by enlarging the content of promoters (Zn and Ni) and promoting the dispersion of deposited particles. Moreover, the addition of Ni can significantly improve the catalytic performance of the copper-based catalysts, which is ascribed to the regulation of reaction process and inhibition of Cu-Zn alloy. Among the obtained catalysts, the MW-Cu/Ni-95 developed at 95 degrees C exhibits a higher catalytic activity, which reaches 91.7% conversion at 250 degrees C. Most significantly, it shows the excellent catalytic performance as compared with the commercial catalyst under the same test conditions. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The results showed that N additions inhibited the soil N-related hydrolytic enzyme activities, especially in 392 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) treatment. As N additions increased, the amoA gene copy ratios of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) to ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) decreased from 1.13 to 0.65. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the AOA gene copies were negatively related with NH4+-N content. However, the AOB gene copies were positively correlated with NO3--N content. Moderate N application rates (56-224 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) accompanied by P additions are beneficial to maintaining the abundance of AOB, as opposed to the inhibition of highest N application rate (392 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) on the abundance of AOB. This study suggests that the abundance of AOB and AOA would not decrease unless N applications exceed 224 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in temperate grasslands in Inner Mongolia.

Herein, an environmentally friendly Schiff base cross-linked compact three-dimensional network structure bio-adhesive (DAC-PEI-U) derived from poly-ethyleneimine (PEI), urea, and cellulose was successfully prepared, verifying by detailed FTIR, NMR, and XPS analysis. Schiff base bridging between aldehyde groups in dialdehyde cellulose (DAC) and amino groups in polyurea (PEI-U) not only constructed crosslinking networks but also endowed adhesives with good adhesion property. The dry bond strength of DAC-PEI-U adhesive reached 2.71 MPa, and the wet shear strength was 1.51 MPa (hot water) and 1.34 MPa (boiling water), respectively. It not only improves the water resistance and bonding process, but also displays simple synthesis and low cost. The improved performance of DAC-PEI-U adhesive is attributed to the generation of hyperbranched cross-linking structure in the adhesive system, which results in increased cross-linking density and promotes the formation of dense cross-sections in the curing adhesive. This work paves a solid way for developing cellulose-based wood adhesives with wet bonding prop-erties, thus holding great potential as an alternative to formaldehyde-type adhesives in wood-based panel and indoor panel bonding industries.						liu, tong da/0000-0002-5563-6925													0141-8130	1879-0003				DEC 31	2022	223		A				971	979		10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.11.069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.11.069		NOV 2022						36375662					WOS:000892273000006

Here, we report a highly stable and efficient Ti/TiONC/Sb-SnO2 electrode, which was fabricated through hydrothermal reactions using urea to form TiONC interlayers and electrodeposition-annealing to coat the active SbSnO2 catalysts. The triple-layered anode was characterized by highly crystalline structures, high oxygen evolution potentials, and corrosion-resistance properties. The structural arrangement yielded better electrocatalytic performances than that using the control electrode (Ti/Sb-SnO2), showing enhanced organics degradation efficiencies. This new electrode's lifetime was significantly (similar to 25 times) longer than that of either the control or any Sb-SnO2 electrode modified with non-precious materials reported in the literature. The electrode's enhanced stability was attributed to the insertion of the mixed C and N interlayers that are resistant to oxidants and corrosive ions. The Ti/TiONC/Sb-SnO2 anode holds promise for use in electrochemical water treatment.

AuBr3-Catalyzed Chemoselective Annulation of Isocyanates with 2H-Azirine	CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL												The chemoselective cyclization of isocyanates with 2H-azirine was achieved with AuBr3 as catalyst. This transfer sets the stage for the synthesis of aromatic oxazole-ureas in a tandem process. The addition of a catalytic amount of phosphite enhances the process enormously. The reaction can also be performed in a one-pot process using benzoyl azide instead of isocyanate under the same conditions. A detailed study on the role of the phosphite that was applied as an additive revealed that only non-coordinated phosphite can reduce gold(III) and that gold(I) coordinated phosphite is not oxidized. Accompanied by the reduction of gold, HBr is generated in situ, which turned out to be the actual promotor in combination with the remaining AuBr3. The positive effect of acid can be explained by a strong N-Au coordination, which tends to break more easily in the presence of small amount of protic acid in the reaction solution.

Graphene Oxide Supported Oxovanadium (IV) Complex for Catalytic Peroxidative Epoxidation of Styrene: An Eye-Catching Impact of Solvent	APPLIED ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY												Graphene oxide (GO) supported transition metal complexes are apprised as sturdy and everlasting heterogeneous catalysts. GO surface was functionalized with 3-triethoxysilylpropylamine (TSPA) and this amino functionalized GO (A-f-GO) nanocomposite with vanadyl Schiff base complex (VO-f-GO) was prepared and to give credence of its potentiality, it was chosen for the selective epoxidation of styrene using environmentally benign 30% H2O2 to styrene oxide (SO). To evade the detrimental exposure of "inborn" water, a selective high boiling and potent hygroscopic solvent, ethylene glycol was chosen to make this transformation productively successful. With the assistance of theoretical studies, we have probed the effect of H2O2 on to structural properties, binding mechanism and electronic properties of the catalyst and substrate. Adsorption energy (E-ad), energy band gap (E-g) and HOMO-LUMO were also calculated. Based on DFT calculations, resonance Raman and UV/Vis studies, we confirmed the formation of metal-peroxo species and propose the plausible catalytic pathway. The influence of the diverse experimental parameters, like substrate to oxidant mole ratio, catalyst concentration, type of solvents, solvent amount, time, temperature and oxidant were tested. A clear relationship was found between different reaction parameters like solvent amount, oxidant, catalyst concentration and temperature etc. and product distribution. This heterogeneous catalyst yielded styrene oxide as nearly the sole product (selectivity = 98.7%) with a conversion value of 99.2% in the oxidation of styrene with hydrogen peroxide in ethylene glycol.

The results show that the denitrification efficiency can reach 20 % when the reaction temperature is 650 degrees C, and the optimum mole ratio of C3H8/NH3 is 0.5. The denitrification efficiency can exceed 50 % when the mole ratio of C3H8/NH3 is 0.4 and the reaction temperature is 720 degrees C. However, the CH4 additive does not promote denitrification at this temperature. When the reaction temperature is 760 degrees C, the optimum denitrification efficiency of CH4 is 60 %, and the required CH4/NH3 is 0.8. Once the amount of CH4 exceeds the optimal value, the denitrification efficiency is suppressed. In addition, the concentrations of N2O and CO in the gas increase significantly with an increase of gas additives. Due to the incomplete oxidation of C3H8, a large amount of C2H4 is produced in the low-temperature region (< 750 degrees C) of SNCR.																			2194-5748	1542-6580				MAR	2019	17	3							20180148	10.1515/ijcre-2018-0148	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ijcre-2018-0148													WOS:000461759600007

The crystal structure belongs to the space group Pna2(1) and was characterized by Raman and FT-infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis. Catalyst activities were evaluated through the synthesis of glycerol carbonate from glycerol and urea using a batch reactor. After the optimization of both reaction and reaction conditions, the activity results showed that the coordination polymer used as a heterogeneous catalyst has good values of conversions and selectivity for the manufacturing of glycerol carbonate in a fine-chemical process. The analysis of powder X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy for the coordination polymer employed, before and after the reaction, shows that some changes have taken place in the crystal structure during the process, in spite of a recovery at the end of the reaction. The advantages and limitations of the coordination polymer were discussed and compared with those of the previous heterogeneous catalysts in the literature.					de Souza, Patterson/LXV-9480-2024; Leitão, Alexandre/V-6947-2019; Diniz, Renata/B-3546-2015; Chagas, Poliane/N-8501-2018; Amarante, Giovanni/U-8268-2019; Oliveira, Luiz/E-8376-2017; Franco, Chris Hebert/G-8110-2014	Franco, Chris Hebert/0000-0001-6876-3969; de Souza, Patterson Patricio/0000-0002-1907-5876; Amarante, Giovanni Wilson/0000-0003-1004-5395; Leitao, Alexandre/0000-0002-1439-486X													1477-9226	1477-9234				AUG 28	2018	47	32					10976	10988		10.1039/c8dt01803k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8dt01803k								30020278					WOS:000441713000020

By introducing manganese ions, the composition can be freely manipulated. To investigate whether there was a hybrid synergic effect in CH4 combustion reaction, further detailed characteristics of Mn-doped CeO2 with various manganese contents were revealed by XRD, Raman, FT-IR, SEM, EDS, XPS, OSC, H-2-TPR, and N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements. The doping manganese is demonstrated to increase the storage of oxygen vacancy for CH4 and enhance the redox capability, which can efficiently convert CH4 to CO2 and H2O under oxygen-rich condition. The excellent catalytic performance of MCO-3 sample, which was obtained with the starting Mn/Ce ratios of 0.2 in the initial reactant compositions, is associated with the larger surface area and richer surface active oxygen species.

Hence, a considerable number of experimental and theoretical studies have been carried out to investigate their outstanding chemical and physical properties in both pristine and modified forms. In this study, we investigated the electronic, structural, optical, and photocatalytic properties of g-C3N4 obtained by heating urea in an appropriate self-supporting NH3(g) atmosphere. The X-ray diffraction results revealed that the g-C3N4 nanopowder was crystalline and had a hexagonal structure. The crystallite size varied from 3.61 to 3.49 nm depending on the NH3(g) concentration. The Fourier transform infrared analysis confirmed that g-C3N4 was synthesised successfully. The optical properties of g-C3N4 were investigated on the basis of its photoluminescence spectrum, which showed a broadband with blue region emission (similar to 490 nm). The decay time of g-C3N4 was used to evaluate its photocatalytic performance. An understanding of the structural defects in g-C3N4-based materials can provide an insight into their outstanding chemical and physical properties.

In this study, catalytic ceramic membranes with active cobalt oxides loaded onto Al2O3 flat ceramic membranes are synthesized and combined with ozone micro-nano bubble (MNB) to treat a ROC from Iron & Steel industry. Compared with conventional aeration method, ozone MNBs show a much smaller bubble size (mainly concentrated at 80-200 nm) and doubled the dissolved ozone concentration. With the urea assisted impregnation method, Co3O4 particles were loaded on the outer surface and inner pore of ceramic membranes (Co-CMU), which showed the highest efficiency in COD removal for the ROC. The quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis confirmed that the main active species involved in this coupled process were 1O2 and & sdot;OH. The ozone MNBs/Co-CMU not only enhanced the destruction of organic pollutants but also reduced the membrane fouling, resulted from a combined action of various physical and chemical processes. The Co-CMU catalysts showed high catalytic stability in five cycles of reuse with negligible cobalt leaching. Especially, the operation cost in this coupled process for per unit COD removal is decreased by 2.5 times, comparing with conventional ozonation process.					xie, yongbing/AAO-2079-2021														2214-7144					MAY	2024	61								105213	10.1016/j.jwpe.2024.105213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2024.105213		APR 2024											WOS:001221185500001
J	Liu, DJ; Zhang, Z; Luo, F; Wu, J				Liu, Dongjing; Zhang, Zhen; Luo, Fei; Wu, Jiang			Elemental Mercury Capture from Simulated Flue Gas by Graphite-Phase Carbon Nitride	ENERGY & FUELS												Graphite-phase carbon nitrides (g-C3N4), composed of only C, N, and some impurity H, have been synthesized by direct thermal polymerization of urea in air and employed to capture elemental mercury (Hg-0) from simulated flue gas. The performance and kinetic behavior of g-C3N4 toward Hg-0 adsorption are investigated. Its optimal polymerization temperature and ramping rate are 550 degrees C and 5 K/min, respectively. It shows extraordinary affinity with elemental mercury associated with an Hg-0 removal efficiency >77% at 40-240 degrees C under a nitrogen atmosphere, which is probably attributed to its unique electronic structure property and fluffy tremella-like morphology with ample exposed adsorption sites. The Hg-0 may be captured on the sp(2)-bonded carbon atoms in g-C3N4 by producing carbon-mercury (C-Hg) covalent bonds via Lewis acid-base interaction. The presence of O-2 slightly reduces the mercury capture efficiency, while the Hg-0 removal efficiency greatly decreases by nearly a half in the presence of H2O, NO, and SO2, which is plausibly owing to the competitive adsorption or deletion of active sites on the g-C3N4 surface. The process of Hg-0 adsorption on g-C3N4 is controlled by both intraparticle diffusion and chemisorption processes.

However, the effect of anion on CO-SCR catalyst modification is rarely reported. In this study, four different LDHs precursors were synthesized by using urea hydrothermal method and introducing different inorganic anions into the reaction system to control the self-assembly growth during the synthesis of LDHs. It is then loaded with a mass ratio of 7.5 % copper by impregnation method. The LDO(N)/Cu7.5 catalyst using nitrate ions regulated LDH as support achieved a high NO conversion of 96 % at 150 degrees C, which outdistanced the LDO(S)/ Cu7.5 with support regulated by sulfate ions. A series of characterizations demonstrated that CoFe-LDH modified with different anions could modulate the valence state of loaded copper species. Among them, the LDO(N)/Cu7.5 catalyst was able to produce more Cu+ as the active site for the catalytic reaction. In situ DRIFTS further revealed the reaction mechanism, following the E-R mechanism at <= 150 degrees C and the L-H mechanism at 200-350 degrees C. This work supplies a new idea for the valence modulation of copper and the modification of LDH materials for applications in CO-SCR.

The synthesis method used was sol gel from the hydrolysis of titanium tetrabutoxide with urea solution, combined with a low temperature treatment at atmospheric pressure. The theoretical mole ratio N/Ti was equal to 0.5 and the theoretical mole ratio HNO3/TiO2 was equal to 0.5. The solid obtained was calcined at different temperatures in static air with high heating rate and residence time of 1 hour. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, FTIR Raman and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, thermodifferential and thermogravimetric analysis and specific surface area. All calcined solids exhibit absorption in the visible range. The Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction revealed for all the heat treatments, the presence of crystalline phases corresponding to anatase and brookite polymorphism. The photocatalytic activity of the catalysts was tested in degradation of an artificial dye under visible light, yielding the best results for the sample treated at 250 degrees C. Our results allow to say that this behaviour is due to the absorption of visible light, good efficiency for the adsorption of the dye and presence of two crystalline phases that decreases the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The synthesis technique used allows obtaining solids with textural and attractive photocatalytic properties.

Herein, a MgFeAl layered double hydroxide/carbonitride (LDH/CN) heterostructure was constructed via triggering the interlayer reaction of citric acid (CA) and urea. CA as a structure-directing agent regulated the interlayer anion of MgFeAl-LDH, which enabled an interfacial tuning in the process of coupling with CN. The obtained LDH/CN heterostructure, as an efficient PMS activator, achieved nearly 100% bisphenol A (BPA) removal rate in 10 min with high specific activity (0.146 L min(-1)center dot m(-2)). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests, quenching experiments, electrochemical characterization and X-ray photoelectrons spectroscopy (XPS) tests were applied to clarify the mechanism of BPA degradation. The results unraveled that the activity of the catalyst originated from the heterostructure of LDH and CN with an efficient interfacial electron transfer, which promoted the fast generation of O-2(center dot-) for rapid pollutant degradation. In addition, the catalyst exhibited excellent applicability in realistic wastewater. This work offered a rational strategy for forming a heterostructure catalyst with a fine interface engineering in actual environmental cleanup.

Despite the high yields obtained for ceria catalysts, the reduction of the amount of side products and the prevention of catalyst deactivation still represent major hurdles in this chemistry. One advantage of ceria is the possibility of tuning its reactivity by doping its lattice with other metals. In the present work, a series of doped ceria-based materials, prepared by substitution with metals, are evaluated in the methoxycarbonylation of 2,4-diaminotoluene with dimethyl carbonate. Among all catalysts, containing Eu, Hf, La, Pr, Sm, Tb, Y or Zr, ceria promoted with 2 mol % Zr exhibited 96 % selectivity towards the desired carbamates, improving the pure CeO2 catalyst. Density functional theory demonstrates that two descriptors are needed: 1) a geometric factor that governs the reduction of energy barriers for carbamate formation through ureas; 2) catalyst basicity as N-H bonds need to be activated. Assessment in subsequent reaction cycles revealed that the CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst is more stable than bulk CeO2, along with the reduction of fouling processes.

Template-free synthesis of mesoporous manganese oxides with catalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS												Porous manganese carbonate was obtained via solvothermal synthesis using ethanol and urea. The manganese carbonate was subsequently used as a precursor to synthesise mesoporous manganese oxides via thermal treatments at three various temperatures. X-ray diffraction and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) results shows that g-MnO2 is synthesised at 380 and 450 degrees C while Mn2O3 is produced at the annealing temperature of 575 degrees C. X-ray absorption spectra show that g-MnO2 converts completely to Mn2O3 after annealing over the 450-575 degrees C range. The oxides obtained at 380 degrees C and 450 degrees C possess extremely high specific surface area, which is of interest for catalytic applications. The oxides were investigated as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction; the oxide prepared at the lowest annealing temperature was found to be the optimum catalyst with an overpotential of 427 +/- 10 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), normalised by the geometric area. The improved catalytic activity was related to the presence of defect-rich and highly porous manganese dioxide at the lowest annealing temperature.

Removal of Sudan IV from a simulated biphasic oily wastewater by using lipophilic carbon adsorbents	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												Several chemically and thermally modified activated carbons were tested in the adsorption of a lipophilic pollutant (Sudan IV) contained in biphasic oil-water mixture mimicking petroleum refinery effluents. The effect of different parameters on the adsorption performance has been assessed, such as the absence of water, particle size of the carbon material and the respective chemical and thermal modifications, initial concentration of pollutant, water/oil volume ratio, nature of the organic phase (cyclohexane, n-hexane or n-hexadecane) and the presence of an emulsifier (sodium dodecyl sulphate). Lipophilicity of the adsorbent was found to be a key parameter in the purification of the organic phase. Successive treatments of the parent commercial activated carbon Norit ROX 0.8, namely with nitric acid, urea, followed by a thermal treatment at 800 degrees C under inert atmosphere, developed the highest adsorption capacity (q(e) = 200 mg.g(-1)) in the base material. A load of 2.5 g.L-1 of this modified carbon was able to completely remove 500 mg.L-1 of the pollutant from the organic phase after 8 h of contact time, owing to the highest specific surface area (S-BET = 1055 m(2).g(-1)) and characteristic surface chemistry with the lowest content of oxygen surface groups among the tested adsorbents.

The Pd-loaded and N-doped TiO2 photocatalysts were prepared by post-incorporation method using K2PdCl4 and urea, respectively, as precursors. A variety of surface analysis techniques were used for characterization of surface and functional group while using ultraviolet/visible (UV-vis) analysis for monitoring photocatalytic degradation of MO. Kinetic parameters were obtained using Langmuir-Hinshelwood model to determine the degradation rate constants. It was found that the metal-loaded titanium dioxide degraded MO in water at a higher rate than did non-metal-loaded titanium dioxide fabricated by using the post-synthesis method. Also, the pure P25-TiO2 degraded MO more than N-doped TiO2 because of decreased surface area by particle agglomeration after being made by the post-incorporation method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Artificial neural network (ANN) as a modern tool was used to predict this response, too. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) models were used to predict the modulus of rapture (MOR) and the statistics, including the determination coefficient (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to validate the prediction. Combining the ANN and the genetic algorithm by using the multiple objective and nonlinear constraint functions, the optimum point was determined based on the experimental and estimated data, respectively. The characterization analysis, performed by FTIR and XRD, was used to describe the effect of the inputs on the output. The results indicated that the statistics obtained show excellent MOR predictions by the feed-forward neural network using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms. The comparison of the optimal output of the actual values obtained by the genetic algorithm resulting from the multi-objective function and the optimal output of the values estimated by the nonlinear constraint function indicates a minimum difference between both functions.

Greater degradationof AO7 was achieved by all modified samples with PDS compared withthat of pristine AC, where the NSAC/PDS system achieved the highestdegradation performance. Quenching tests, electrochemical analysis,and theoretical calculations suggested that the degradation of AO7led by modified carbon catalysts and PDS was mainly attributed tothe non-radical pathway (e.g., singlet oxygen formation and electron-transfermechanism). The doping of N or S resulted in the generation of pyridinicN and thiophenic S. These groups significantly changed the chargedistribution, creating more abundant edge defects and active sites,which enhanced the catalytic degradation of AO7. Co-doping of AC withN and S produced a higher abundance of graphitic N groups and edgedefect, which likely promoted AO7 degradation compared with the othercatalysts. The results of this study can provide theoretical supportfor the application of N/S-modified carbon materials for activatingpersulfates to effectively treat dyeing wastewater.					jiang, yuyu/JOJ-7864-2023; Mameda, Dr. Naresh/AAV-2711-2020; zhang, xiaolei/D-7698-2012; Chen, Huihui/L-8521-2019; Liu, Qiang/GRE-7145-2022; Nghiem, Long/I-9012-2018	Liu, Qiang/0000-0002-1625-6436; Nghiem, Long/0000-0002-9039-5792; Zhang, Xiaolei/0000-0002-7199-7245													0888-5885	1520-5045				JUL 19	2023	62	30					11894	11904		10.1021/acs.iecr.3c01467	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.3c01467		JUL 2023											WOS:001032153700001

In this work, we introduce an alcohothermal synthesis method for fabricating NiFe-LDHs with dehydrated galleries. The proposed process involves incomplete hydrolysis of urea for the simultaneous precipitation of metal ions, with the resulting water-deficient ethanol environment leading to the formation of a dehydrated structure. The formation of a gallery-dehydrated layer structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as well as by a subsequent rehydration process. The methodology introduced here is also applicable for fabricating Fe-based LDHs (NiFe-LDH and NiCoFe-LDH) nanoarrays, which cannot be produced under the same conditions in aqueous media because of the different precipitation processes involved. The LDH nanoarrays exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction, as a result of their high intrinsic activity and unique structural features. In summary, this study not only introduces a new method for synthesizing LDH materials, but also provides a new route towards highly active and robust electrodes for electrocatalysis.					duan, xue/S-8482-2016; Lu, Zhiyi/T-1500-2017; Xu, Wenwen/KXR-5605-2024; Sun, Xiaoming/C-1443-2013	Tian, Yang/0000-0002-9293-5852; Sun, Xiaoming/0000-0002-3831-6233													1998-0124	1998-0000				OCT	2016	9	10					3152	3161		10.1007/s12274-016-1197-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12274-016-1197-4													WOS:000385194100028

The FeMn@N-BC was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffract meter, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, and found that N-doping can form a larger specific surface area. Catalytic degradation experiments showed that Fe/Mn bimetal doping not only accelerated the electron cycling rate on the catalyst surface, greatly improved the catalytic effect, but also made the biochar magnetic and easy to separate, thus reducing environmental pollution. The performance of BPA degradation was compared under different kinds of biochar materials, and it was concluded that the highest degradation efficiency of BPA was achieved when the mass ratios of urea and chicken manure, Fe/Mn were 3:1 and 2:1, respectively, and the pyrolysis temperature was 800 degrees C, which can almost degrade all the BPA in 60 min. After 4 cycles of FeMn@N-BC, the efficiency of BPA removal can still reach about 75%, showing good reuse potential. FeMn@N-BC/PS system with high catalytic efficiency and low consumables is promising for the reuse of waste resources and the remediation of wastewater.																			0273-1223	1996-9732				AUG 15	2024	90	4					1149	1163		10.2166/wst.2024.275	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2024.275		AUG 2024						39215729					WOS:001289289300001

Application of bacterial algicides is a promising way to control HABs. However, the identified bacterial algicides against Chlorella and the under-standing of their effects on algal metabolism are very limited. Here, we isolated a novel bacterium Microbacterium paraoxydans strain M1 that has significant algicidal activities against Chlorella vulgaris (algicidal rate 64.38 %, at 120 h). Atrazine-desethyl (AD) was then identified from strain M1 as an effective bacterial algicide, with inhi-bition or algae-lysing concentration values (EC50) of 1.64 mu g/mL and 1.38 mu g/mL, at 72 h and 120 h, respectively. LAD (2 mu g/mL AD) or HAD (20 mu g/mL AD) causes morphology alteration and ultrastructure damage, chlorophyll a reduction, gene expression regulation (for example, psbA, 0.05 fold at 24 h, 2.97 fold at 72 h, and 0.23 fold of the control in HAD), oxidative stress, lipid oxidation (MDA, 2.09 and 3.08 fold of the control in LAD and HAD, respectively, at 120 h) and DNA damage (average percentage of tail DNA 6.23 % at 120 h in HAD, slight damage: 5 similar to 20 %) in the algal cells. The impacts of AD on algal metabolites and metabolic pathways, as well as the algal response to the adverse effects were investigated. The results revealed that amino acids, amines, glycosides and urea decreased significantly compared to the control after 24 h exposure to AD (p < 0.05). The main up-regulated metabolic pathways implied metabonomic resistance and defense against osmotic pressure, oxidative stress, photosynthesis inhibition or partial cellular structure damage, such as phenylalanine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis. The down-regulated glycine, serine and threonine metabolism is a major lead in the algicidal mechanism according to the value of pathway impact. The down-regulated glycine, and serine are responsible for the downregulation of glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, and sulfur metabolism, which strengthen the algae-lysing effect. It is the first time to highlight the pivotal role of glycine, serine and threonine metabolism in algicidal activities, which provided a new perspective for understanding the mechanism of bacterial algicides exerting on algal cells at the metabolic level.

Here, this work demonstrated that bauxite residue could be reused as a superior cathode for heterogeneous electro-Fenton (EF) process to degrade organic pollutants. With bauxite residue and straw as raw materials, a Fe-C-N contained catalyst was successfully prepared via a pyrolysis route in the presence of urea. This Fe-C-N contained catalyst exhibited promising electrocatalytic performance to reduce O-2 to produce H2O2 and activate H2O2 to generate (OH)-O-center dot simultaneously. As a heterogeneous EF cathode, 97% of rhodamine B (10 mg L-1) could be degraded within 45 min at pH 3 with a catalyst dosage of 0.2 mg mL(-1), which was comparable to those reported advanced EF cathodes. The appropriate reduction of Fe-contained minerals and carbonization of straw with N doping were attributed to the superior catalytic properties. Thus, the current study provides a feasible strategy to reuse bauxite residue and upgrade them into value-added electrode material. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we systematically studied the effects of the synthetic conditions of mineralizer concentration, reaction temperature and facet directing agent on the crystal shape formation of La0.5Sr0.5MnO3. The shapes of single crystal La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 have been controllably grown as cube, octahedron, rhombicuboctahedron and sphere by a high concentration KOH mineralized mild hydrothermal method with urea (CO(NH2) 2) as crystal facet directing agent. The crystal growth mechanism for different facets has been analyzed according to Bravais-Friedel-Donnay-Harker theory. The as-grown facets for the different shapes of crystals indicate that the surfaces of La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 are composed of {100}, {110} and {111} facets. Electrochemical cyclic and linear sweeping voltammetry measurement by rotating ringdisk electrode of these crystals indicates a facet-dependent process for oxygen reduction catalysis.

After the extraction of olive oil by pressing or centrifuging, the obtained liquid contains oil and vegetation water which is subsequently separated by decanting or centrifugation. Despite its treatment throughout the extraction process, this olive mill wastewater, OMW, still contains a very important oily residue, always regarded as a rejection. The separated oil from OMW can not be intended for food because of its high acidity of 3.397% which exceeds the international standard for human consumption defined by the standard of the Codex Alimentarius, proving its poor quality. This work gives value addition to what would normally be regarded as waste by the extraction of oleic acid as a high value product, using the technique of inclusion with urea for the elimination of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids through four successive crystallizations at 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C to have a final phase with oleic acid purity of 95.49%, as a biodegradable soap and a high quality glycerin will be produced by the reaction of saponification and transesterification.

Sulfuric acid nucleation: An experimental study of the effect of seven bases	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Nucleation of particles with sulfuric acid, water, and nitrogeneous bases was studied in a flow reactor. Sulfuric acid and water levels were set by flows over sulfuric acid and water reservoirs, respectively, and the base concentrations were determined from measured permeation rates and flow dilution ratios. Particle number distributions were measured with a nano-differential-mobility-analyzer system. Results indicate that the nucleation capability of NH3, methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine with sulfuric acid increases from NH3 as the weakest, methylamine next, and dimethylamine and trimethylamine the strongest. Three other bases were studied, and experiments with triethylamine showed that it is less effective than methylamine, and experiments with urea and acetamide showed that their capabilities are much lower than the amines with acetamide having basically no effect. When both NH3 and an amine were present, nucleation was more strongly enhanced than with just the amine present. Comparisons of nucleation rates to predictions and previous experimental work are discussed, and the sulfuric acid-base nucleation rates measured here are extrapolated to atmospheric conditions. The measurements suggest that atmospheric nucleation rates are significantly affected by synergistic interactions between ammonia and amines.

J	Shi, WJ; Du, M; Ye, C; Zhang, QF				Shi, Wenjun; Du, Ming; Ye, Chen; Zhang, Quanfa			Divergent effects of hydrological alteration and nutrient addition on greenhouse gas emissions in the water level fluctuation zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China	WATER RESEARCH												Changes in global rainfall patterns and construction of artificial dams have led to widespread alteration of hydrological processes in riparian ecosystems. At the same time, many riparian ecosystems, such as those associated with the Yangtze, are being subjected to enhanced inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) due to intensified agricultural activity in surrounding uplands. Together, these environmental changes may alter the magnitude and direction of greenhouse gasses (GHGs) fluxes from riparian soils. We conducted an in situ experiment combined with quantitative PCR approach (qPCR) to elucidate the effects of hydrological alterations (continuous flooding (CF), periodic flooding (PF), and no flooding (NF)) and nutrient addition (N addition (urea, 100 kg N ha-1 y-1), P addition (P2O5, 20 kg ha- 1y- 1), N + P addition, and control (CK)) on three major GHGs including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes as well as the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that hydrological alterations greatly affected GHGs emissions, possibly by altering soil moisture, soil organic C, and C:N ratios. The CF, with higher soil moisture and lower C:N ratio, increased CH4 emissions 13fold and reduced CO2 and N2O emissions by 37.3% and 72.2% averaged over the growing seasons compared with no flooding. PF enhanced CH4 emissions 5.7-fold and decreased N2O emissions by 69.0% in comparison with no flooding. Nutrient additions had no significant effect on CO2 or CH4 flux, but P addition significantly lowered N2O flux. Interactions between hydrological alterations and nutrient additions were not detected for any GHGs. As a result, hydrological alterations and nutrient additions affected the global warming potential (GWP) of growing season GHG budgets on a 100-year time horizon, mainly by changing the CO2 emissions. CF reduced GWP from 597 to 439 g CO2-eq m- 2, and N + P addition enhanced GWP from 489 to 625 g CO2-eq m- 2. The qPCR analysis revealed that decreased CH4 oxidation potential may lead to the enrichment of CH4 emissions under the hydrological alterations, and reduced nitrification and denitrification potential contributed to the reduction of N2O fluxes under all the treatments. Our study indicates that continuous flooding could curb the contribution of riparian GHGs fluxes to global warming but that the combination of N and P additions may increase the greenhouse effect mainly by regulating the CO2 emissions of growing season in riparian ecosystem.

The use of stoichiometric bioenergetics to elucidate metabolic energy substrate use and specific dynamic action in cultured juvenile spiny lobsters (Sagmariasus verreauxi) of different nutritional status	AQUACULTURE												Simultaneous measurements of nitrogenous (ammonia and urea) excretion and respiratory gas (O-2 and CO2) exchange provide a non-destructive stoichiometric bioenergetic approach to elucidate metabolic energy substrate use which has rarely been used with aquatic ectotherms due to previous difficulties in measuring total CO2 excretion. This study examined metabolic energy substrate use and specific dynamic action (SDA) in cultured spiny lobster, Sagmariasus verreauxi, of different nutritional status. SDA magnitude calculated by stoichiometry was compared to a traditional composite oxycalorific coefficient approach. Protein synthesis can account for a large part of SDA in aquatic ectotherms. This study used a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to investigate the contribution of cycloheximide-sensitive protein synthesis to SDA and the effect of cycloheximide on nitrogenous and CO2 excretion. Lobsters were subjected to five treatments: 2-day fasted juveniles sham injected with saline (FS treatment); 2-day fasted juveniles injected with cycloheximide (FC treatment); 10-day starved juveniles injected with cycloheximide (SC treatment); post-prandial juveniles fed squid Nototodarus sloanii (FED treatment) and; post-prandial juveniles injected with cycloheximide (FEDC treatment). Protein was the primary energy substrate (65% of oxygen consumption) for 2-day fasted juveniles, with lipid accounting for the remainder (35%). After 10-day starvation lipid became the main substrate, indicating lipid oxidation increased with extended fasting. Following feeding, protein contribution remained above 50%, while lipid (0-43%) and carbohydrate (0-37%) provided significant energy at different time periods, indicating besides protein appropriate proportions of non-protein ingredients are also essential to lobsters. SDA magnitude in FED and FEDC treatments estimated by the traditional approach was 10.5 and 0.4 J g(-1), respectively, indicating S. verreauxi expended 96% of post-prandial energy on protein synthesis and that decapod protein synthesis can account for one of the highest proportions of SDA in aquatic ectotherms. SDA magnitude in the FED treatment evaluated by stoichiometry (12.6 J g(-1)) was comparable to the traditional approach. Interestingly, stoichiometry was not applicable in the FEDC treatment as the respiratory quotient exceeded the theoretical maximum under aerobic conditions. Cycloheximide did not affect CO2 excretion among all treatments or nitrogenous excretion among unfed treatments, while the post-treatment total nitrogenous excretion reduced in fed lobsters. The combined measurement of substrate use and SDA potentially helps optimize the feed to achieve sustainable aquaculture. However, more research is required to decipher limitations and the applicability of stoichiometry for crustaceans.					; WANG, Shuangyao/JNT-4380-2023; Carter, Chris G./A-3438-2008; Smith, Gregory/C-9263-2013	Fitzgibbon, Quinn/0000-0002-1104-3052; WANG, Shuangyao/0000-0003-1074-011X; Carter, Chris G./0000-0001-5210-1282; Smith, Gregory/0000-0002-8677-1230													0044-8486	1873-5622				FEB 15	2021	532								736021	10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736021													WOS:000600429200014

The present study aimed to explore the protective effects on diabetic nephropathy rats by alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress and the underlying mechanism. High-fat diet/STZ induced rats and high glucose (HG) induced podocytes (MPC5) were used to simulate the DN in vivo and in vitro. The blood glucose level was measured using a blood glucose meter and renal function was determined by an automatic biochemical analyzer. The pathological changes and renal fibrosis were observed through hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff and Masson staining. The expression of nephrin in tissues, fibrosis-related proteins in tissues, MAPK/NF-kappa B and ERK/nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling pathway related proteins in tissues and apoptosis related proteins in tissues and podocytes was detected by western blotting. The inflammatory response and oxidative stress in tissues and podocytes were determined by respective commercial kits and apoptosis in tissues and podocytes was detected by TUNEL assay. The viability of podocytes treated with PGG with or without HG was analyzed by CCK-8 assay. As a result, the blood glucose level, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine in blood were all increased and nephrin expression was decreased. The pathological changes and renal fibrosis were aggravated and the inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis in renal tissues were enhanced. The above effects were reversed by PGG treatment dose-dependently. MAPK/NF-kappa B and ERK/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways were activated in DN rats and were suppressed by PGG treatment. The reduced viability and increased apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative stress in MPC5 cells were shown in HG induction, which was reversed by PGG treatment. However, P79350 (p38 agonist) and LM22B-10 (ERK1/2 agonist) weakened the effect of PGG. In conclusion, PGG protects against DN kidney injury by alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress by suppressing the MAPK/NF-kappa B and ERK/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways.																			1792-0981	1792-1015				OCT	2022	24	4							639	10.3892/etm.2022.11576	http://dx.doi.org/10.3892/etm.2022.11576								36160883					WOS:000890579800001

In this study, a simple preparation method using urea was utilized to synthesize GCN. In order to understand various morphological, structural, and optical aspects of the as-prepared sample, GCN was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Brunauere-Emmette-Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and diffused reflectance spectra (DRS) analysis. The visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity of prepared GCN was analyzed for various cationic dyes (Crystal violet, rose bengal, rhodamine B, auramine O, methylene blue) and anionic dyes (phenol red, xylenol orange, cresol red, methyl orange). The calculated efficiencies of degradation and values of apparent rate constant for all dye samples suggested that cationic dyes are more actively degraded using GCN than anionic dyes. In addition, GCN was further analyzed for its splendid antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniaandEscherichia coli). The synthesized photocatalyst holds a bright scope for the efficient remediation of organic pollutants and bacterial disinfection in wastewater.

The liver is rich in glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) that catalyzes the reversible oxidative deamination of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia, thus bridging amino acid-to-glucose pathways. Here we generated inducible liver-specific GDH-knockout mice (HepGlud1(-/-)) to explore the role of hepatic GDH on metabolic homeostasis. Investigation of nitrogen metabolism revealed altered ammonia homeostasis in HepGlud1(-/-) mice characterized by increased circulating ammonia associated with reduced detoxification process into urea. The abrogation of hepatic GDH also modified energy homeostasis. In the fasting state, HepGlud1(-/-) mice could barely produce glucose in response to alanine due to impaired liver gluconeogenesis. Compared with control mice, lipid consumption in HepGlud1(-/-) mice was favored over carbohydrates as a compensatory energy fuel. The changes in energy partitioning induced by the lack of liver GDH modified the circadian rhythm of food intake. Overall, this study demonstrates the central role of hepatic GDH as a major regulator for the maintenance of ammonia and whole-body energy homeostasis.					; Emre, Yalin/L-6856-2017	Maechler, Pierre/0000-0002-2005-1433; Emre, Yalin/0000-0003-3125-9560													0012-1797	1939-327X				OCT	2018	67	10					1949	1961		10.2337/db17-1561	http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db17-1561								30002133					WOS:000445059100005

However, relatively little research has been conducted on sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (SI-AKI). As an important trigger of ferroptosis, how mitochondrial damage plays a regulatory role in SI-AKI is still unclear. To explore the potential relationship between mitochondria and ferroptosis, we established a SI-AKI rat model by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Transcriptome sequencing was used to detect changes in gene transcription levels in the control group, LPS 3 h group, LPS 6 h group and LPS 12 h group. The severity of kidney injury was determined based on serum creatinine (CRE), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), tissue HE staining, TUNEL staining and inflammatory factor levels. Cytoscape software was utilized to screen several mitochondria-related HUB genes, and NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] ferrithionein 3 (NDUFS3) was selected for subsequent validation due to its novelty and feasibility. qRT-PCR, Western blot was employed to evaluate the expression of NDUFS3 in kidney tissues. GO enrichment analysis revealed that up-regulated genes in the LPS 12 h group were enriched in several cell death terms while down-regulated genes were enriched in lipid metabolic process and oxidation-reduction progress terms. Furthermore, Western blot, IHC, MDA, GSH and iron content levels were used to assess ferroptosis in the kidney tissue of the SI-AKI rats, dihydroethidium (DHE) assay and ATP kit were used to assess mitochondrial ROS levels and mitochondrial function. To further validate the function of NDUFS3, we constructed overexpression rats using hydrodynamic method by tail vein injection of pc DNA3.1-NDUFS3 overexpression plasmid. we utilized LPS to stimulate HK-2 cells and establish an in vitro model. We then overexpressed NDUFS3 using pcDNA 3.1. The overexpression of NDUFS3 was found to inhibit LPS-induced ferroptosis and mitochondrial damage in HK-2 cells, as evidenced by Western blot, MDA, GSH, divalent iron, ROS levels, Mitosox red, ATP content and transmission electron microscopy. Finally, the use of Compound C to inhibit AMPK in HK-2 cells demonstrated that NDUFS3 plays a protective role through the AMPK pathway. Therefore, our study supports the emerging role of NDUFS3 in SI-AKI, providing new potential mitochondria-related targets for the treatment of SI-AKI.					jin, yingyu/MIK-8882-2025; Wang, Yuchen/JXM-9534-2024														1567-5769	1878-1705				DEC 25	2024	143		2						113393	10.1016/j.intimp.2024.113393	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2024.113393		OCT 2024						39426231					WOS:001338783200001

Effects of colostrum instead of formula feeding for the first 2 days postnatum on whole-body energy metabolism and its endocrine control in neonatal calves	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE												Colostrum provides high amounts of nutritive and non-nutritive substrates, which are essential for calf nutrition and passive immunization. Colostral growth factors and hormones have beneficial effects on postnatal maturation and may affect substrate utilization and energy expenditure in neonatal calves. We tested the hypothesis that energy metabolism and its endocrine regulation differ during the first 10 d of life in calves fed either colostrum or a milk-based formula with a similar nutrient composition to colostrum, but largely depleted of bioactive substances, for the first 2 d postnatum. Male Holstein calves (n = 18) were fed either pooled colostrum (COL; n = 9) or a milk-based formula (FOR; n = 9) for the first 2 d of life. From d 3 on, all calves received same milk replacer. On d 2 and 7 of life, calves were placed in a respiration chamber for indirect calorimetric measurements to calculate heat production, fat (FOX) and carbohydrate oxidation (COX), as well as respiratory quotient. Blood was sampled on d 1 before first colostrum intake and on d 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10 before morning feeding, to measure plasma concentrations of immunoglobulins, metabolites, and hormones. Additional postprandial blood samples were taken on d 1 and 9 at 30, 60, 120, 240, and 420 min after milk feeding. Liver samples were collected on d 10 of life to determine gene expression related to energy metabolism. Formula-fed calves showed lower plasma concentrations of total protein, immunoglobulins, haptoglobin, leptin, adiponectin, arid insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein (IGFBP)-4 during the whole study but temporarily higher plasma concentrations of urea, insulin, glucagon, triglyceride, and cholesterol on the first day after feeding, compared with concentrations in COL. The temporary increase in glucagon, triglyceride, and cholesterol on d 1 reversed on d 2 or 3, showing higher concentrations in COL than in FOR calves. In FOR, IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 were lower on d 3 than in COL. Interestingly, FOR calves had higher heat production during respiratory measurements on d 2 and higher body temperature on d 2, 3, and 5 than those of COL. The hepatic rnRNA abundance of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was higher in FOR than in COL. Our results indicate that first milk feeding after birth influenced whole-body energy expenditure but riot FOX and COX in neonatal calves, and the absorption of colostral leptin and adiponectin might affect insulin sensitivity on d 1 of life.

J	Resitoglu, IA; Altinisik, K; Keskin, A				Resitoglu, Ibrahim Aslan; Altinisik, Kemal; Keskin, Ali			The pollutant emissions from diesel-engine vehicles and exhaust aftertreatment systems	CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY												Diesel engines have high efficiency, durability, and reliability together with their low-operating cost. These important features make them the most preferred engines especially for heavy-duty vehicles. The interest in diesel engines has risen substantially day by day. In addition to the widespread use of these engines with many advantages, they play an important role in environmental pollution problems worldwide. Diesel engines are considered as one of the largest contributors to environmental pollution caused by exhaust emissions, and they are responsible for several health problems as well. Many policies have been imposed worldwide in recent years to reduce negative effects of diesel engine emissions on human health and environment. Many researches have been carried out on both diesel exhaust pollutant emissions and aftertreatment emission control technologies. In this paper, the emissions from diesel engines and their control systems are reviewed. The four main pollutant emissions from diesel engines (carbon monoxide-CO, hydrocarbons-HC, particulate matter-PM and nitrogen oxides-NOx) and control systems for these emissions (diesel oxidation catalyst, diesel particulate filter and selective catalytic reduction) are discussed. Each type of emissions and control systems is comprehensively examined. At the same time, the legal restrictions on exhaust-gas emissions around the world and the effects of exhaust-gas emissions on human health and environment are explained in this study.

This study was conducted to determine the effects of varying levels of DON in diets on growth performance, serum biochemical profile, jejunal morphology, and the differential expression of nutrients transporter genes in growing pigs. Results: A total of twenty-four 60-day-old healthy growing pigs (initial body weight = 16.3 +/- 1.5 kg SE) were individually housed and randomly assigned to receive one of four diets containing 0, 3, 6 or 12 mg DON/kg feed for 21 days. Differences were observed between control and the 12 mg/kg DON treatment group with regards to average daily gain (ADG), although the value for average daily feed intake (ADFI) in the 3 mg/kg DON treatment group was slightly higher than that in control (P<0.01). The relative liver weight in the 12 mg/kg DON treatment group was significantly greater than that in the control (P<0.01), but there were no significant differences in other organs. With regard to serum biochemistry, the values of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) in the 3 treatment groups were higher than those in the control, and the serum concentrations of L-valine, glycine, L-serine, and L-glutamine were significantly reduced in the 3 treatment groups, especially in the 12 mg/kg DON group (P<0.01). Serum total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were markedly decreased after exposure to DON contaminated feeds (P<0.01). The villi height was markedly decreased and the lymphocyte cell numbers markedly increased in the 3 DON contaminated feeds (P<0.01). The mRNA expression levels of excitatory amino acid transporter-3 (EAAC-3), sodium-glucose transporter-1 (SGLT-1), dipeptide transporter-1 (PepT-1), cationic amino acid transporter-1 (CAT-1) and y+L-type amino acid transporter-1 (LAT-1) in control were slightly or markedly higher than those in the 3 DON treatment groups. Conclusions: These results showed that feeds containing DON cause a wide range of effects in a dose-dependent manner. Such effects includes weight loss, live injury and oxidation stress, and malabsorption of nutrients as a result of selective regulation of nutrient transporter genes such as EAAC-3, SGLT-1, PepT-1, CAT-1 and LAT-1.

Epoxidation of alkenes with NaIO4 catalyzed by an efficient and reusable natural polymer-supported ruthenium(III) salophen catalyst	JOURNAL OF THE IRANIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												In the present study, preparation, characterization, and catalytic activity of Ru(salophen)Cl supported on chitosan were investigated. The prepared heterogeneous catalyst was characterized by diffuse reflectance UV-vis and FT-IR spectroscopic techniques, scanning electron microscopy, and neutron activation analysis. In this catalytic system, the effects of different solvents were studied in the epoxidation of cis-cyclooctene and CH3CN/H2O was found to be a better solvent. Also, the effects of oxygen donors such as NaIO4, H2O2, H2O2/urea(UHP), tert-BuOOH, NaClO, and Bu4NIO4 were studied in the epoxidation of cis-cyclooctene and NaIO4 was selected as an oxidant. The catalytic activity of this new heterogeneous catalyst in the epoxidation of cyclic and linear alkenes using NaIO4 as an oxidant in CH3CN/H2O at room temperature was studied. The obtained results led us to conclude that [Ru(salophen) Cl@chitosan] is an efficient catalyst for the epoxidation of alkenes with NaIO4. The catalyst can be readily recovered simply by filtration and reused several times without any significant loss in its catalytic activity.

Effect of Yarrowia lipolytica yeast biomass with increased kynurenic acid content on selected metabolic indicators in mice	PEERJ												Background: The unconventional yeast species Yarrowia lipolytica is a valuable source of protein and many other nutrients. It can be used to produce hydrolytic enzymes and metabolites, including kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endogenous metabolite of tryptophan with a multidirectional effect on the body. The administration of Y. lipolytica with an increased content of KYNA in the diet may have a beneficial effect on metabolism, which was evaluated in a nutritional experiment on mice.Methods: In the dry biomass of Y. lipolytica S12 enriched in KYNA (high-KYNA yeast) and low-KYNA (control) yeast, the content of KYNA was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Then, proximate and amino acid composition and selected indicators of antioxidant status were compared. The effect of 5% high-KYNA yeast content in the diet on the growth, hematological and biochemical indices of blood and the redox status of the liver was determined in a 7 -week experiment on adult male mice from an outbred colony derived from A/St, BALB/c, BN/a and C57BL/6J inbred strains. Results: High-KYNA yeast was characterized by a greater concentration of KYNA than low-KYNA yeast (0.80 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.01 g/kg dry matter), lower content of crude protein with a less favorable amino acid composition and minerals, higher level of crude fiber and fat and lower ferric-reducing antioxidant power, concentration of phenols and glutathione. Consumption of the high-KYNA yeast diet did not affect the cumulative body weight gain per cage, cumulative food intake per cage and protein efficiency ratio compared to the control diet. A trend towards lower mean corpuscular volume and hematocrit, higher mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and lower serum total protein and globulins was observed, increased serum total cholesterol and urea were noted. Its ingestion resulted in a trend towards greater ferric-reducing antioxidant power in the liver and did not affect the degree of liver lipid and protein oxidation.Conclusions: The improvement of the quality of Y. lipolytica yeast biomass with increased content of KYNA, including its antioxidant potential, would be affected by the preserved level of protein and unchanged amino acid profile. It will be worth investigating the effect of such optimized yeast on model animals, including animals with metabolic diseases.

Heat stress-induced deficits in growth, metabolic efficiency, and cardiovascular function coincided with chronic systemic inflammation and hypercatecholaminemia in ractopamine-supplemented feedlot lambs	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												Heat stress hinders growth and well-being in livestock, an effect that is perhaps exacerbated by the beta 1 agonist ractopamine. Heat stress deficits are mediated in part by reduced feed intake, but other mechanisms involved are less understood. Our objective was to determine the direct impact of heat stress on growth and well-being in ractopamine-supplemented feedlot lambs. Commercial wethers were fed under heat stress (40 degrees C) for 30 d, and controls (18 degrees C) were pair-fed. In a 2 x 2 factorial, lambs were also given a daily gavage of 0 or 60 mg ractopamine. Growth, metabolic, cardiovascular, and stress indicators were assessed throughout the study. At necropsy, 9th to 12th rib sections (four-rib), internal organs, and feet were assessed, and sartorius muscles were collected for ex vivo glucose metabolic studies. Heat stress increased (P < 0.05) rectal temperatures and respiration rates throughout the study and reduced (P < 0.05) weight gain and feed efficiency over the first week, ultrasonic loin-eye area and loin depth near the end of the study, and four-rib weight at necropsy. Fat content of the four-rib and loin were also reduced (P < 0.05) by heat stress. Ractopamine increased (P < 0.05) loin weight and fat content and partially moderated the impact of heat stress on rectal temperature and four-rib weight. Heat stress reduced (P < 0.05) spleen weight, increased (P < 0.05) adrenal and lung weights, and was associated with hoof wall overgrowth but not organ lesions. Ractopamine did not affect any measured indicators of well-being. Heat stress reduced (P < 0.05) blood urea nitrogen and increased (P < 0.05) circulating monocytes, granulocytes, and total white blood cells as well as epinephrine,TNF alpha, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Cortisol and insulin were not affected. Heat stress reduced (P < 0.05) blood pressure and heart rates in all lambs and increased (P < 0.05) left ventricular wall thickness in unsupplemented but not ractopamine-supplemented lambs. No cardiac arrhythmias were observed. Muscle glucose uptake did not differ among groups, but insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation was reduced (P < 0.05) in muscle from heat-stressed lambs. These findings demonstrate that heat stress impairs growth, metabolism, and well-being even when the impact of feed intake is eliminated by pair-feeding and that systemic inflammation and hypercatecholaminemia likely contribute to these deficits. Moreover, ractopamine improved muscle growth indicators without worsening the effects of heat stress.

J	Holecek, M				Holecek, Milan			The Role of Skeletal Muscle in The Pathogenesis of Altered Concentrations of Branched-Chain Amino Acids (Valine, Leucine, and Isoleucine) in Liver Cirrhosis, Diabetes, and Other Diseases	PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH												The article shows that skeletal muscle plays a dominant role in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; valine, leucine, and isoleucine) and the pathogenesis of their decreased concentrations in liver cirrhosis, increased concentrations in diabetes, and nonspecific alterations in disorders with signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), such as burn injury and sepsis. The main role of skeletal muscle in BCAA catabolism is due to its mass and high activity of BCAA aminotransferase, which is absent in the liver. Decreased BCAA levels in liver cirrhosis are due to increased use of the BCAA as a donor of amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate for synthesis of glutamate, which in muscles acts as a substrate for ammonia detoxification to glutamine. Increased BCAA levels in diabetes are due to alterations in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and fatty acid oxidation. Decreased glycolysis and citric cycle activity impair BCAA transamination to branched-chain keto acids (BCKAs) due to decreased supply of amino group acceptors (alpha-ketoglutarate, pyruvate, and oxaloacetate); increased fatty acid oxidation inhibits flux of BCKA through BCKA dehydrogenase due to increased supply of NADH and acyl-CoAs. Alterations in BCAA levels in disorders with SIRS are inconsistent due to contradictory effects of SIRS on muscles. Specifically, increased proteolysis and insulin resistance tend to increase BCAA levels, whereas activation of BCKA dehydrogenase and glutamine synthesis tend to decrease BCAA levels. The studies are needed to elucidate the role of alterations in BCAA metabolism and the effects of BCAA supplementation on the outcomes of specific diseases.																			0862-8408	1802-9973				JUN	2021	70	3					293	305		10.33549/physiolres.934648	http://dx.doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.934648								33982576					WOS:000675528500001

Herein, we report atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that are both highly active and thermally stable in fuel cells and electrolyzers operating above 600 degrees C. We developed a urea-based chemical synthetic method that strongly anchors atomic-scale Pt species on the surface of ceria nanoparticles and prevents their agglomeration at high temperatures. Doping the ceria with gadolinia further enhances their catalytic properties by increasing the oxygen vacancy concentration and promoting the oxygen exchange kinetics. This process enables in situ synthesis within the porous electrode of realistic solid oxide cells and significantly improves the power output and H2 production rate in fuel cell and electrolysis modes, respectively. Furthermore, this electrode stably operated without noticeable degradation during a long-term evaluation, thus proving the excellent thermal stability of atomically dispersed Pt/ceria catalysts. Atomically dispersed Pt catalysts supported on ceria nanoparticles are synthesized in situ and improve the performance and stability of high-temperature solid oxide cells for electricity and hydrogen production.

Thin films were synthesized by a sol-gel method, successfully. Spectroscopy and chemical oxygen demand techniques were used to assess the progress and efficiency of the reaction. UV Vis results demonstrated that at natural pH 5.8 of the sample solution, maximum decomposition of 87-99% of azo dyes in 4 h has happened under visible irradiation with a primary concentration of 25 mg/l. According to COD results, after 4 h, a decreasing of the COD values from the azo dyes of solution significantly was obtained in the same condition. Besides, our results demonstrated, which nanostructure of TiO2/Zn-urea thin films with the highest efficiency decomposition, are recycled and permanent, showing a good potential of this technique in practical application.

Surface Modification Using Ultraviolet-Ozone Treatment Enhances Acute Drug Transfer in Drug-Coated Balloon Therapy	LANGMUIR												Endovascular deployment of drug-coated balloons (DCB) is an emerging strategy for the revascularization of arterial disease. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated DCB effectiveness, but a recent meta-analysis reported increased mortality risk in humans with use of DCBs containing the common antiproliferative drug paclitaxel. While many factors could have contributed to adverse outcomes, current DCB designs have poor drug delivery efficiency, risk of systemic toxicity, and limited potential to retain therapeutic drug concentrations within the arterial wall following the procedure. Our study focuses on developing a strategy to enhance acute drug transfer from the balloon to the arterial wall over the short procedural window (similar to 30-120 s). We employed ultraviolet-ozone plasma (UVO) treatment to increase the hydrophilicity of a prototypical balloon material (Nylon-12) and subsequently applied a urea-paclitaxel coating previously shown to undergo favorable adhesive interactions with the arterial wall under simulated ex-vivo deployment. A series of assays were performed to characterize our experimental DCBs in terms of UVO-induced alterations in balloon surface hydrophobicity, formed coating microstructure, coating stability, and acute drug transfer to the arterial wall. Obtained results suggest that the UVO-based surface modification of angioplasty balloons is a promising design strategy and highlights the critical role of coating microstructure in determining the drug transfer efficiency in DCB therapy.

Postpartum supplementation with fermented ammoniated condensed whey altered nutrient partitioning to support hepatic metabolism	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE												Our previously published paper demonstrated that fermented ammoniated condensed whey (FACW) supplementation improved feed efficiency and metabolic profile in postpartum dairy cows. The objective of this study was to further explore the effects of FACW supplementation on liver triglyceride content, hepatic gene expression and protein abundance, and plasma biomarkers related to liver function, inflammation, and damage. Individually fed multiparous Holstein cows were blocked by calving date and randomly assigned to postpartum (1 to 45 d in milk, DIM) isonitrogenous treatments: control diet (n = 20) or diet supplemented with FACW (2.9% dry matter of diet as GlucoBoost; Fermented Nutrition, Luxemburg, WI, replacing soybean meal; n = 19). Liver biopsies were performed at 14 and 28 DIM for analysis of mRNA expression, protein abundance, and liver triglyceride content. There was marginal evidence for a reduction in liver triglyceride content at 14 DIM in FACW-supplemented cows compared with the control group. Cows supplemented with FACW had greater mRNA expression of glucose6-phosphatase at 14 DIM relative to control. Supplementation with FACW increased mRNA expression of pyruvate carboxylase (PC), but did not alter cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1), resulting in a 2.4-fold greater PC:PCK1 ratio for FACWsupplemented cows compared with control. There was no evidence for a FACW effect on mRNA expression of propionyl-CoA carboxylase nor on mRNA expression or protein abundance of lactate dehydrogenase A or B. Cows supplemented with FACW had lower plasma urea nitrogen compared with control. Plasma l-lactate was greater for FACW-supplemented cows compared with control at 2 h before feeding time at 21 DIM. There was no evidence for altered expression of IL1B or IL10, or blood biomarkers related to liver function and damage. Greater glucose-6-phosphatase and PC gene expression, together with greater blood glucose and similar milk lactose output, suggests that FACW increased the supply of glucose precursors, resulting in greater gluconeogenesis between 3 and 14 DIM. Greater hepatic PC:PCK1 ratio, together with previously reported decreased plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and the marginal evidence for lower liver triglyceride content at 14 DIM, suggests greater hepatic capacity for complete oxidation of fatty acids in FACW-supplemented cows compared with control. Overall, improvements in metabolite profile and feed efficiency observed with postpartum supplementation of FACW may be attributed to increased gluconeogenic and anaplerotic precursors, most likely propionate, due to modulated rumen fermentation.

Highly efficient catalytic reductive degradation of various organic dyes by Au/CeO 2 -TiO 2 nano-hybrid	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL SCIENCES												Highly improved catalytic reductive degradation of different organic dyes, in the presence of excess NaBH4 over Au/CeO2-TiO2 nano-hybrid as the catalyst is reported in this study. CeO2-TiO2 nanocomposite was prepared by a facile co-precipitation method using ultra-high dilute aqueous solutions. Small amount of Au (only 1 wt%) was loaded onto the nanocomposite material by deposition-precipitation with urea (DPU) method to fabricate the ternary Au/CeO2-TiO2 nano-hybrid. The catalysts were characterized by the representative techniques like XRD, BET surface area, ICP-AES, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, TEM and XPS. The Au/CeO2-TiO2 nano-hybrid along with NaBH4 exhibited remarkable catalytic activities towards all the probed dyes, namely Methylene Blue, Methyl Orange, Congo Red, Rhodamine B and Malachite Green, with a degradation efficiency of similar to 100% in a short reaction time. The degradation reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to the concentration of the dye. Different parameters that affect the rate of the reaction are discussed. A plausible mechanism for methylene blue degradation has also been proposed.

Herein, a cost-effective, nonhazardous, and environment-friendly nonmetal, such as sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), and boron (B)-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), was synthesized through thermal decomposition of urea. Moreover, diverse morphologies were obtained, which exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity. The synthesized nonmetal-doped g-C3N4 composites were exercised for the photodegradation of methyl blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. In the photodegradation process, the decontamination removal rate of MB is achieved by (S-g-C3N4, P-g-C3N4, B-g-C3N4, and g-C3N4) samples of about 99%, 87%, 60%, and 40%, respectively, and the maximum pseudo-first-order reaction constant "K" 44.00 min x 10(-3) was achieved. S-doped g-C3N4 showed enhanced photodegradation activity in comparison with pristine g-C3N4 and other nonmetal-doped g-C3N4 composites due to a favorable bandgap of 2.4 eV, attributing to more visible energy absorption. The promising photodegradation mechanism of MB using g-C3N4 composites is discussed. Moreover, the photodegradation route MB and the possible photocatalytic mechanism are mainly investigated.

The trend of using medicinal plants in the management of DM is increasing exponentially. Etlingera elatior is a medicinal plant that contains chemicals and antioxidants that delay the oxidation process. However, available data focusing on its use on DN are inconsistent and scarce. This study aims to investigate the antidiabetic and nephroprotective effects of E. elatior flower aqueous extract (EEAE) in a type 2 DM rat (T2DR) model. The T2DR model was developed using a combination of a high-fat diet (HFD) and a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ) at 35 mg/kg. Thirty-two Sprague Dawley male rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 8): (1) control (normal rat), (2) T2DR (untreated-type 2 diabetic rat), (3) Met (250 mg/kg metformin-treated T2DR), and (4) EEAE (1000 mg/kg EEAE-treated T2DR). All treatments were administered orally for 6 weeks. EEAE significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG), microalbuminuria, serum creatinine, and serum blood urea nitrogen. EEAE also reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) and enhanced the levels of antioxidant markers-superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC). The inflammatory marker (interleukin (IL)-6) and fibrosis markers (transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)) were significantly decreased in the EEAE-treated group. The T2DR group developed DN, which was characterized by segmental sclerosis of the glomeruli associated with focal tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Interestingly, the histology of kidney tissue in the EEAE group was preserved. This effect was similar to that of the control drug metformin. In summary, the antidiabetic and nephroprotective effects might be related to the antioxidant properties and anti-inflammatory effects of the EEAE. The antidiabetic activity could be due to the presence of the active compound cyanidin-3-O-glycosides, which is an anthocyanin antioxidant, that is present in the EEAE. E. elatior has the potential to be developed as a natural source of antioxidants that can be used for the prevention or even the treatment of DM. These findings could lead to future research into the therapeutic use of E. elatior in alleviating the progression of DM and thus preventing nephropathy.

Compared to CWT-400-Air, CWT@g-C3N4(2)-300-N-2 exhibits lower crystalline anatase TiO2 and larger specific surface area, which improves the dispersion of Ce/W/Ti species on catalysts surface. Furthermore, the introduction of g-C3N4 as supports also contributes to doping C/N elements into Ce-W-Ti catalyst and increases the Ce3+/(Ce3++Ce4+) and O-alpha/(O-alpha+O-beta) molar ratios on catalyst surface. These all are advantageous to the NH3-SCR activity. However, UCN shows better promotional effect than MCN and TCN. This might be mainly attributed to the loose and porous stacked layered fold structure of UCN, the larger BET surface area, higher dispersion of Ce/W/Ti species and moderate weak/medium-strong acid sites of CWT@UCN(2)-300-N-2. At the same time, the influence of carbon nitride amount, calcination atmosphere and calcination temperature on the NH3-SCR activity of CWT@g-C3N4 catalyst were also investigated.

Irrespectively to the starting material, wurtzite-like Ga-Zn-oxynitride phases formed. The preparation was completed by deposition of a Pt co-catalyst, which was activated by either reduction in hydrogen or calcination in air. It was demonstrated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) that during oxidative activation the oxynitride started to transform into a nitrogen-free Zn-containing Ga- oxyhydroxide. Regardless to the structure of the catalysts after the activation step, almost complete oxynitride to oxyhydroxide transformation was observed during the methanol photocatalytic reforming reaction, accompanied by complete reduction of the Pt co-catalyst to metallic state. The observations of this study point to the importance of phase transitions under reaction conditions in the development of the active ensemble in the Ga,Zn-based photocatalysts.

However, the optimal catalytic activity of MPOD is mostly in acidic conditions (pH 2-5), mis-matching the optimal catalytic alkaline environment of uricase. In this paper, using CuSO4 and urea as raw materials, a MPOD with high catalytic activity in alkaline environment was synthesized by hydrothermal method. Then, based on coupling reaction of uricase/UA/MPOD/guaiacol (GA) system, a novel spectrophoto-metric method was established to detect 5-60 mu mol/L UA (limit of detection = 3.14 mu mol/L (S/N = 3)) and accurately quantified serum UA (275.6 +/- 39.9 mu mol/L, n = 5) with 95-105% of standard addition recovery. The results were consistent with commercial UA kit (p > 0.05). The MPOD could replace natural POD to reduce the cost of UA detection due to simple preparation and cheap raw materials, and is expected to achieve the specific detection of some substances, like glucose and cholesterol, combined with glucose oxidase and cholesterol oxidase.

The Morphology of PtNPs-SeNPs-SnO(2)NPs@BFTO showed flower, spherical and irregular shapes by FESEM investigation.

The physicochemical properties of the as-prepared samples were characterized by various techniques such as X-ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microcopy, etc. The samples demonstrate a unique core-shelled structure and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra reveal the presence of high concentration of Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies at the surface, which accounts for their black appearance. A possible mechanism for the formation of such core shell structure is proposed based on the results (X-ray photoelectron spectra, etc) of products prepared under different ration between urea and hydrochloric acid. Ethanol absolute is found to have critical effect in preventing phase transition of titania (from anatase to rutile) upon elevated temperatures. The black appearance of the sample powder (high visible light absorption) as well as slow electron/hole recombination rate after introducing oxygen vacancies/N species signify the core-shelled anatase titania as an efficient visible light active photocatalyst.

However, the low capacity of pristine MXene limits its application in energy storage devices such as lithium ion batteries. To solve this problem, we synthesized a new type of N-doped two-dimensional Nb2CTx MXene. The nitrogen content of N-doped MXene was 4.5 at% after thermal reaction with urea. The introduction of nitrogen into MXene nanosheets increases c-lattice parameter of Nb2CTx MXene from 22.32 angstrom to 34.78 angstrom. And the incorporation of nitrogen into MXene nanosheets leads to superior electrochemical performance. For example, the N-doped Nb2CTx shows an increased reversible capacity of 360 mAh /g at 0.2C, which is much higher than that of the un-doped Nb2CTx MXene (190 mAh/g at 0.2C). And the N-doped Nb2CTx MXene also shows excellent cycling stability (288 mAh/g at 0.5C after 1500 cycles). Our results suggest N-doped Nb2CTx MXene is promising for energy storage applications.

The best catalytic performance, propylene conversion of 12.8%, propylene oxide selectivity of 76.2% and PO space-time yield of 160.9 g(po)/Kg(cat)/h, was obtained at the reaction temperature of 300 degrees C. The Ti/Si molar ratio of the supports and some experimental parameters, such as the urea amount, loading temperature and Au loading on the as-produced catalyst are optimized. In addition, with the assistance of in-situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (In-situ FT-IR), adsorption and desorption of PO, propylene and the reaction mixture on the catalyst are conducted to further explore the deactivation mechanism.

The synthesis was done by a template method using SiO2 as template and organic chemicals including guanidine hydrochloride (GndCl), dicyandiamide and urea as precursors. Characterizations by XRD, FT-IR, XPS, N-2 physisorption and TEM indicated that the assumed mpg-C3N4 is synthesized irrespective of the precursor used. However, the surface chemistry of mpg-C3N4, evaluated from TGA and CO2-TPD, varied with the precursors and the mass ratio (r) of SiO2 to precursor. Catalytic results showed that the sample prepared using GndCl as precursor and at mass ratio of SiO2 to GndCl equals to 0.7, defined as mpg-C3N4_G((0.7)), exhibits the best activity for the reactions, due to its rich surface basic sites and high surface area. Thus 89% conversion was obtained within 30 min using hexanoyl chloride as electrophile at 90 degrees C. Even at room temperature (27 degrees C), 75% conversion can be observed within 30 min. The catalyst is also reusable with ca. 80% activities recoverable after washing with ethanol. The excellent catalytic performances, as well as its low cost, straightforward synthesis and metal-free characters, make mpg-C3N4_G((0.7)) a potential catalyst for Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene in industry with a "green" route.

However, its broad application is inhibited by the costly raw materials, noble-metal catalysts and the toxic effect of organic molecules on catalysts. Herein, we report a novel anti-poisoning MP-MOx (M = Ni, Fe and Mo) bifunctional catalyst that can combine the energy-saving H-2 production with sewage disposal simultaneously by directly electrolyzing the wastewater containing organic molecules. The MP-MOx catalyst expresses a commendable electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction and electrooxidation decomposition of small organic molecules (EDM), as well as a remarkable anti-toxicity for organic molecules and a long-term durability. As compared with traditional water electrolysis, the organic electrolytic system exhibits an excellent cell efficient with a cell voltage reducing of 120 mV and can dramatically allow electrical energy savings up to 8% at 10 mA cm(-2).

Characteristics and products of the reductive degradation of 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO) and 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN) in a Fe-Cu bimetal system	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												It has been shown previously that, under acidic conditions, 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO) and 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN) degrade in the presence of iron/copper bimetal particles; the reactions can be modeled by pseudo-first-order kinetics. This study investigates the reaction mechanisms of the degradation processes under different conditions. Batch studies were conducted using laboratory-prepared solutions and an industrial insensitive munition-laden (IMX) wastewater. The influence of parameters such as initial pH of the solution, copper/iron (Fe-Cu) contact, and solid/liquid ratio were systematically investigated to assess their impact on the reaction kinetics. These parameters were subsequently incorporated into pseudo-first-order decomposition models for NTO and DNAN. The activation energies for the degradation reactions were 27.40 and 30.57 kJ mol(-1), respectively. Degradation intermediates and products were identified. A nitro-to-amino pathway, which ultimately may lead to partial mineralization, is postulated. The amino intermediate, aminonitroanisole, was detected during DNAN degradation, but for NTO, aminotiazolone is suggested. Additionally, urea was identified as a degradation product of NTO.

Results revealed that N doping can largely promote the PDS activation performance of Co@RBC toward sulfadiazine (SD) degradation in the 3D electrochemical system. The structure-activity relationship analysis revealed that Co0 and sp2-C/sp3-C in catalysts promoted by the doped pyridinic N benefited in strengthening PDS utilization on catalysts surface, thus largely boosting PDS activation efficiency for SD degradation in the system even with a low PDS dosage (0.5 mM). And pyridine N and Co0 were main active sites for PDS activation. Integrating with reactive species trapping experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), it revealed that singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide radical (& BULL;O2 ) and surface-bounded radicals made main contribution to SD degradation. In addition, the as prepared Co@RBC-3 N exhibited excellent and stable catalytic activity, good anti-interference of natural water matrices, and easily magnetic separation from solution. This study developed an effective, stable and easily recovery catalysts for PDS activation in 3D electrochemical system and promoted the application possibility of this system for antibiotics removal from wastewater.					liu, jiayun/MDS-8703-2025; Wang, Min/HSF-4621-2023														2213-2929	2213-3437				OCT	2023	11	5							110870	10.1016/j.jece.2023.110870	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2023.110870		AUG 2023											WOS:001070736700001

CGO20-CuO composites synthesized by the combustion method and characterized by H2-TPR	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL												CGO-CuO composites are promising anode materials for low and intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT/IT-SOFCs). In this work, several CGO-CuO (65:35; 50:50 y 35:65 mol/mol%) composites by urea combustion synthesis yielding to fine reactive powders at low temperatures were prepared. The resulting powder composites were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption-desorption (BET) and scanning electron microscopy-energy disperse X-ray (SEM-EDS). Additionally, hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR) tests were carried out, in order to elucidate reducibility of the powders. H-2-TPR tests exhibited two primary reduction peaks, which correspond to the following stages: the first one (150-350 degrees C) can be ascribed to the reduction of CuO species into metallic Cu; while the second one (750-900 degrees C) can be ascribed to the bulk Ce4+ -> Ce3+ reduction process of the support (CGO). Further, after H-2-TPR reduction of the asprepared CGO-CuO compositions, powders exhibit the presence of metallic Cu and the fluorite CGO solid solution that remains stable whereas any CuO is no longer noticed.

The phosphorous and weak acid group contents, and the weight recovery ratio increased with increasing reaction time, and were 1.9 and 4 5 mmol/g, and 114%, respectively, when the reaction time was 20 min. Therefore, numerous phosphate ester and weak acid groups were introduced into the pulp, maintaining its fibrous morphology and cellulose I crystal structure. It was found that almost all the ammonium phosphate groups in the phosphorylated pulp behaved as weak acids. The solid-state carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13-NMR) spectrum of the phosphorylated pulp showed that neither carboxy nor carbamate groups were formed in the phosphorylated pulp; only phosphate ester groups were introduced into the pulp under the conditions used in the present study. The X-ray photoelectron spectra of the phosphorylated pulp surfaces suggested that ammonium phosphate groups were introduced into the pulp by phosphorylation. A longer reaction time or a greater amount of (NH4)(2)HPO4 added during phosphorylation resulted in lower water swelling behavior, indicating that some intrafiber and/or interfiber crosslinking occurred in the pulp under these conditions. The results obtained in the present study show that phosphorylated pulp fibers are suitable for the preparation of new functional cellulosic sheets and materials, in which large amounts of weak acid groups can be used as scaffolds for diverse ion-exchange sites.

The DESs used were choline chloride-urea (DES A) and choline chloride-glycerol (DES B). Both chitosan-DES beads were used to remove malachite green ( MG) dye from an aqueous solution. The optimum pH for chitosan-DES A was recorded at pH 8.0 while optimum pH for chitosan-DES B was pH 9.0. The maximum adsorption capacity obtained for chitosan-DES A and chitosan-DES B were 6.54 mg/g and 8.64 mg/g, respectively. The optimum conditions for both chitosan-DES beads to remove MG were 0.08 g of adsorbent and 20 min of agitation time. Five kinetic models were applied to analyse the data and the results showed that the pseudo-second-order and intraparticle diffusion model fitted best with R-2 > 0.999. For the adsorption capacity, results show that the Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms fitted well with chitosan-DES A and chitosan-DES B, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacities (qmax) obtained from chitosan-DES A and chitosan-DES Bwere 1.43 mg/g and 17.86 mg/g, respectively. Desorption indicated good performance in practical applications.

J	Singh, S; Lo, SL				Singh, Seema; Lo, Shang-Lien			Single-phase cerium oxide nanospheres: An efficient photocatalyst for the abatement of rhodamine B dye	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Single-phase mesoporous CeO2 nanospheres were synthesized by template-free hydrothermal approach by the synthesis of CeCO3OH precursor combined with the calcination at 350 A degrees C for 3.0 h. Precursor and calcined products were characterized by XRD, TGA, FESEM, EDX, TEM, N-2 adsorption-desorption and pore size distribution analysis, UV-vis diffuse reflectance (UV-vis DRS), and photoluminescence (PL) analysis. The morphologies of CeO2 nanospheres were controlled via the optimization of urea concentration during the synthesis. Calcined CeO2 exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity of rhodamine B (RhB) dye degradation under UV-visible irradiation and mild acidic condition. Scavenger test analysis was used to confirm that the hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals, and photogenerated holes are the active photoinduced species of RhB degradation. A comparative study of PL intensity, dye adsorption, and zeta potential measurement revealed the efficient dye adsorption over different CeO2 photocatalysts. The RhB degradation rate constant has been found to raise linearly with increase of the surface properties. Repeatability test analysis proved the higher catalytic stability of CeO2 nanospheres without any noticeable loss of activity. Mass spectroscopy and ion chromatography analyses were used to detect the intermediate by-product formation. Finally, based on the results of intermediate detection, possible degradation pathways were also proposed including radical reactions, ring opening, and de-nitrification.					singh, seema/AGU-5540-2022	singh, seema/0000-0002-6985-6304													0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2018	25	7			SI		6532	6544		10.1007/s11356-017-0902-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0902-5								29255979					WOS:000426571000040

As a kind of typical photocatalyst, g-C3N4 possesses lots of advantages (i.e., facile synthesis, visible-light response, and high stability) in CO2 reduction. However, the poor capacity of CO2 capture and rapid recombination of photo-generated electron and hole, both hinder the further development of g-C3N4 for CO2RR. Herein, we developed a template co-pyrolysis strategy to prepare C-NHx-rich (x = 1 or 2) g-C3N4, to increase the CO2 binding and the subsequent photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency. Specifically, organic molecules with multiple imino groups were used as additives to co-pyrolyze with urea. These additives can act as templates to facilitate the formation of g-C3N4 with abundant C-NHx groups, which effectively improved the capacity of CO2 capture. Meanwhile, the capacity of light absorption and the separation of photo-generated electron and hole were also optimized. As a result, the obtained C-NHx-rich g-C3N4 showed greatly enhanced photocatalytic ac-tivity for CO2RR, over 74-fold higher than that of g-C3N4 conventionally prepared. This work provides a new avenue for optimizing the g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for CO2RR.

The ratio of Mn/Ni/Ti is an important factor to affect the crystallinity of Mn-Ni-Ti solid sulotion, and the catalyst with a Mn/Ni/Ti ratio of 2/3/5 (Mn2-Ni3) exhibits the significant structure distortion. The abundant surface defects induce more generation of Mn4+ species, surface adsorbed oxygen and Lewis acid sites, and acclerate the adsorption and activation of NO molecules. The appropriate Mn/Ni ratio inhibits the competitive adsorption of NH3 with NO, and facilitates the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism to form N-2, which acts as a much more rapid pathway in comparison to the parallel one following Eley-Rideal (E-R) mechanism.

However, whether microcosm studies are able to inform the dynamic changes in communities of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) under field conditions remains poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the transcriptional activities of nitrifying communities under in situ conditions, and we found that they were largely similar to those of C-13-labeled nitrifying communities in the urea-amended microcosms of soils that had received different N fertilization regimens for 22 years. High-throughput sequencing of 165 rRNA genes and transcripts suggested that Nitrosospira cluster 3-like AOB and Nitrososphaera viennensis-like AOA were significantly stimulated in N-fertilized fresh soils. Real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated that the significant increase of AOA and AOB in fresh soils upon nitrogen fertilization could be preserved in the air-dried soils. DNA-based stable-isotope probing (SIP) further revealed the greatest labeling of Nitrosospira cluster 3-like AOB and Nitrosospira viennensis-like AOA, despite the strong advantage of AOB over AOA in the N-fertilized soils. Nitrobacter-like nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) played more important roles than Nitrospira-like NOB in urea-amended SIP microcosms, while the situation was the opposite under field conditions. Our results suggest that long-term fertilization selected for physiologically versatile AOB and AOA that could have been adapted to a wide range of substrate ammonium concentrations. It also provides compelling evidence that the dominant communities of transcriptionally active nitrifiers under field conditions were largely similar to those revealed in "C-labeled microcosms. IMPORTANCE The role of manipulated microcosms in microbial ecology has been much debated, because they cannot entirely represent the in situ situation. We collected soil samples from 20 field plots, including 5 different treatments with and without nitrogen fertilizers for 22 years, in order to assess active nitrifying communities by in situ transcriptomics and microcosm-based stable-isotope probing. The results showed that chronic N enrichment led to competitive advantages of Nitrosospira cluster 3-like AOB over N. viennensis-like AOA in soils under field conditions. Microcosm labeling revealed similar results for active AOA and AOB, although an apparent discrepancy was observed for nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. This study suggests that the soil microbiome represents a relatively stable community resulting from complex evolutionary processes over a large time scale, and microcosms can serve as powerful tools to test the theory of environmental filtering on the key functional microbial guilds.

However, inefficient utilization of the whole solar spectrum, high water dissociation activation energy, and costly materials restrict its widespread applications. Herein, we propose to use non-plasmonic, metal-free, cost-effective and full-spectrum-responsive nitrogen-doped carbon materials prepared by using urea as a nitrogen source for photo-thermo catalytic hydrogen production in accompany with aqueous pollutant degradation. It is demonstrated that the used carbon materials can successfully produce hydrogen and decompose pollutants simultaneously via photo-thermo catalytic reactions upon illumination even with actual biogas slurry. Moreover, strong oxidants can be generated via photo-thermo catalysis in the presence of dissolved oxygen, which promotes hydrogen production. Particularly, due to the photothermal conversion, the redox reaction over carbon materials is enhanced and the activation energy is decreased, facilitating hydrogen production. The generated hydrogen radicals promote the regeneration of active sites for thermocatalytic hydrogen production.

In this work, titania thin films and powders were prepared by a particulate sol-gel route, using titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) as a precursor. Afterwards, the prepared sols were doped with nitrogen (ammonium nitrate, urea), sulfur (thiourea) and platinum (chloroplatinic acid), coated onto glass substrates by dip-coating, and thermally treated in a muffle furnace to promote crystallization. The resulting thin films were then characterized by various techniques (i.e., TGA-DSC-MS, XRD, BET, XPS, SEM, band gap measurements). The photocatalytic activity of the prepared thin films was determined by measuring the degradation rate of plasmocorinth B (PB), an organic pigment used in the textile industry, which can pose an environmental risk when expelled into wastewater. A kinetic model for adsorption and subsequent degradation was used to fit the experimental data. The results have shown an increase in photocatalytic activity under visible-light illumination of nonmetal and metal doped and co-doped titania thin films compared to an undoped sample.

A highly pure, sustainably obtained H-2 stream is desirable to use as the cell feed. In the water gas shift (WGS) process, large amounts of CO, which is a poison for the cell anode, are removed from a bioalcohol-derived H-2 stream before it enters the cell. In this study, Cu-Ni catalysts supported on La-doped ceria were analyzed and studied in the WGS reaction. The supports were prepared by the urea thermal decomposition method with different percentages of La as a promoter of ceria. The metal phase was incorporated by incipient wet impregnation. Many characterization techniques were employed in this work (BET, XRD, SEM, ICP, TPR, OSC), and the relationship between the resulting properties and catalytic performance was investigated to determine the effect of La. A mixture of Cu and Ni was found to be the most effective active phase, having considerable activity and selectivity towards the desired reaction. Low degrees of La doping in ceria enhance oxygen mobility in the lattice. A commercial Ce salt containing La as its main impurity (ca. 2%) is a convenient precursor, given its good performance and low cost compared to a high-purity salt.

Herein, utilizing ionic compound NaF and heteroatom-N-rich urea as morphology directing reagents, ultralong needle-like N-doped Co(OH)F supported on carbon fiber paper has been synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal method. Specifically, the hydrothermal kettle provides a stable environment for the formation of ultra-long needle-like structures. Meanwhile, with the addition of halogen anion F- and heteroatom N, a wealth of oxygen vacancies are obtained, and the OER activity is enhanced. The as-prepared N-doped Co(OH)F-CFP (N:Co(OH)F-CFP) has excellent hydrophilicity, which facilitates its contact with the electrolyte and then accelerates the passing of electrons back and forth between the surface of the material and the electrolyte. Under alkaline conditions, N:Co(OH)F-CFP's OER activity is superior to that of IrO2. Its potential can reach 1.540 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 69.75 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution.

The AC samples were characterized by elemental analysis, N-2 adsorption-desorption, determination of the pH of the point of zero charge (pH(pzc)) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and tested for adsorption behaviors of Hg(II) ions. The experimental data of equilibrium isotherms fitted well with the Langmuir model. ACNS showed the highest adsorption capacity of 511.78 mg/g, increasing more than 2.5 times compared to the original ACA. The adsorption process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. The thermodynamic parameters of Delta H degrees, Delta S degrees, and Delta G degrees at 30 degrees C were -20.57 kJ/mol, -0.032 kJ/mol K and -10.87 kJ/mol, respectively. It was concluded that the Hg(II) ions' adsorption on ACNS was exothermic, spontaneous and physiosorptive in nature. Finally, the adsorption capacity of ACNS reduced by just 8.13% even after the sixth cycle compared to the initial cycle.					; Guo, Lei/C-6558-2014	Chen, Jing/0000-0002-6710-4707; Guo, Lei/0000-0001-7849-9583													0273-1223	1996-9732				APR	2018		1					310	318		10.2166/wst.2018.117	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2018.117								29698245					WOS:000435664600031

In this study, the electro-Fenton (EF) process was performed as a pre-treatment for petrochemical wastewater that resulted from olefin, methanol, aromatic, ammonia, and urea units. The effects of the solution pH, electric current, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration, and reaction time on chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and sludge volume index (SVI) values were investigated. The treated wastewater of an EF process was used as feed for an integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) process. The effect of the ratio of the inlet wastewater volume to the activated sludge in the aeration tank and the influence of the fixed media and retention time on the IFAS system capacity were evaluated. The results showed that an increase in the electric current and H2O2 concentration led to an improvement in the COD removal while increasing the pH had a negative effect on the wastewater treatment. Furthermore, the initial pH of 3, electric current of 160 mA, H2O2 concentration of 65 mM, and reaction time of 30 min were introduced as optimum conditions for the subsequent stage of the treatment. Finally, the IFAS system demonstrated better performance than the conventional activated sludge (AS) method.

It is extremely challenging for dispersing metals in atomic-scales as the applicable high-loading catalysts for industry. The reducible and defective supports or metal surfaces are commonly chosen for anchoring the metals. We here report that atomically-dispersed but high-loading (15 wt%) metals were achieved by covalent-bonding to irreducible SiO2 (though silanol groups) which is realized by a simple urea hydrolysis assistant hydrothermal-deposition method. The Cu-O-Si bonding tailors the structural and electronic states of catalyst by maximum of atom efficiency and tuning electronic effects. The intrinsic performance of C=O hydrogenation was thus boosted by one- to two- orders-of-magnitude in comparison with impregnated and precipitated catalysts. The choices of metals include Cu, Zn, Ni, Co and Mn, showing potentials for a category of applied materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Synthesis of nanocrystalline Co3O4 through solution combustion method: effect of fuel to oxidizer ratio on structural and physical properties	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS												Solution combustion synthesis (SCS) is an energy and time efficient method used for synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles. Here, nanocrystalline Co3O4 samples were synthesized by SCS method using urea as fuel and cobalt acetate tetrahydrate as oxidizer. This study investigates the role of fuel to oxidizer ratio on the physical and structural properties of Co3O4 nanoparticles. Thermodynamic modeling of the reaction provides insights into the heat evolved during the reaction, which increases from 1668 to 12,275 kJ with an increase in fuel to oxidizer ratio from 0.5:1 to 20:1. A maximum crystallite size of 70 nm is obtained at fuel to oxidizer ratio of 5:1, which indicates that maximum practical temperature is attained at this particular fuel concentration. Moreover, this fuel concentration results in the highest vacancy oxygen to lattice oxygen ratio of 0.89 and a corresponding minimum Co3+ to Co2+ ratio of 0.43. A controlled variation of concentration of oxygen vacancies, Co3+, and Co2+ content modifies the optical bandgap of material. The combined effect of delocalized electrons associated with oxygen deficiency sites as well as the cation vacancy controlled hoping conduction results in an improved conductivity of 109 nS/m for the sample prepares at a fuel to oxidizer ratio of 10:1.

Effects of feeding different levels of dried orange pulp and recycled poultry bedding on the performance of fattening lambs	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												The effects of dietary feeding different levels of recycled poultry bedding (RPB) and dried orange pulp (DOP) on the performance of fattening Shal lambs (initial BW of 28 +/- 2.2 kg) were assessed using a factorial experiment (2 x 3) with a completely randomized design. Six diets, containing different levels of RPB (0 or 160 g/kg of DM) and DOP (0, 110, or 220 g/kg of DM), were randomly assigned to 6 groups of 6 lambs each for a 74-d period (14 d for adaptation and 60 d for data collection). Diets were offered as total mixed ration to ensure 10% of orts. Feed intake, growth, diet digestibility, microbial nitrogen (N) synthesis (MNS), N retention, rumen fermentation parameters, and blood metabolites were determined. Data were analyzed using the PROC MIXED of SAS. Increasing RPB and DOP levels in the diet of the lambs improved (P < 0.05) DMI, ADG, and G: F. Diet digestibility was not affected by dietary feeding of RPB (P > 0.05), but increased as DOP level increased in the diet (P < 0.05). Feeding RPB and DOP had no effects (P > 0.05) on the ruminal pH. The ruminal total VFA concentration, molar proportion of acetic acid, and acetate-to-propionate ratio increased (P < 0.05) with the increasing dietary levels of RPB and DOP, while ammonia N concentration, propionic acid proportion, total protozoa count, and Entodiniinae subfamily number decreased (P < 0.05). Including RPB and DOP in diet enhanced (P < 0.05) MNS and N retention. Feeding RPB-containing diets caused (P < 0.05) an increase of plasma glucose concentration and decreases (P < 0.05) of cholesterol and urea N. As the dietary level of DOP increased, the plasma concentrations of glucose, triglycerides, and urea N reduced (P < 0.05). The plasma antioxidant power was not affected (P > 0.05) by feeding RPB, but increased (P < 0.05) with increasing DOP level in diet. The animal performance reached its greatest value with simultaneous feeding of 160 g of RPB and 220 g of DOP per kg of diet DM. It has been concluded that the partial dietary substitution of RPB (instead of soybean meal, wheat bran, and sugar beet pulp) or/and DOP (instead of barley grain and corn grain) in fattening Shal lambs had positive effects on feed intake, diet digestibility, ruminal microbial N, growth, and N retention. Synchronized feeding of the great levels of RPB (as an N source) and DOP (as an energy source) increased utilization efficiency of these byproducts in the fattening lambs.					; Rezaei, Javad/N-2547-2019	Rouzbehan, Yousef/0000-0001-6818-4465; Rezaei, Javad/0000-0001-7956-7832													0021-8812	1525-3163				APR	2017	95	4					1751	1765		10.2527/jas.2016.0889	http://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2016.0889								28464102					WOS:000402314400033

Herein, we report a facile strategy to fabricate four different crystal sized TS-1 with the presence of highly active isolated Ti4+ species by adjusting the amount of TPAOH template. The resultant uncalcined zeolite samples, i.e., TS-1-B, are employed to load Au via deposition-precipitation with urea for obtaining similar sized Au immobilized on TS-1-B catalysts and thus excluding the size effects of Au active sites. The zeolite crystal size effects are further probed, and then decreasing the crystal size gives rise to the simultaneous promotion in PO formation rate and selectivity, as well as H-2 efficiency. These are attributed to the Au-Ti electronic synergy based on UV-vis and XPS measurements. The insights reported here could benefit the development of high-efficiency Au-Ti bifunctional catalysts for this reaction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nitrogen-enriched activated carbons prepared by the activation of coniferous tree sawdust and their application in the removal of Nitrogen dioxide	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A technology of obtaining nitrogen-enriched activated carbons from coniferous tree sawdust by direct activation of the precursor and physical activation with CO2 is described. The effect of activation time, pyrolysis temperature as well as modification with urea on the textural parameters, acid-base character of the surface and sorption properties of activated carbons has been tested. The resulting carbons were characterised by low-temperature nitrogen sorption and determination of the number of surface oxygen groups. The sorption properties of the materials obtained were characterised by nitrogen dioxide adsorption in dry and wet conditions. The final products were nitrogen-enriched microporous activated carbons of medium-developed surface, showing very diverse nitrogen content and acidic-basic character of the surface. The results obtained in our study have proved that through suitable choice of the activation and modification procedure of coniferous tree sawdust, activated carbons can be produced with high capacity towards nitrogen dioxide adsorption, reaching to 69 and 46 mg NO2/g in dry and wet conditions, respectively.

However, it has been evidenced that the ISO has heavy toxicity to the liver system and appears to be a tumor promoter. It is therefore urgent to develop sensitive and selective methods to screen its presence in food resources to meet the ever-increasing pollution restrictions. In this work, an electrochemical sensor based on graphene oxide-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes hybrid material was firstly developed for the rapid and sensitive detection of ISO via square wave voltammetry (SWV). Under optimized experimental conditions, the sensor exhibits a relatively wide linear range from 0.30 to 15.0 mu mol L-1, a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.10 mu mol L-1, as well as good repeatability, high reproducibility, excellent selectivity, and long-term stability. The sensor has also been successfully employed in various real samples such as rice field water, tomato, and lettuce analyses. The obtained recoveries are in the range of 97.33-105.0% with low relative standard deviation (less than 2.5%), which is very close to the results of the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), showing the proposed electrochemical sensor has great potential in practical applications.

Understanding the Visible Absorption of Electron Accepting and Donating CNDs	SMALL												Carbon nanodots (CNDs) synthesized from citric acid and formyl derivatives, that is, formamide, urea, or N-methylformamide, stand out through their broad-range visible-light absorbance and extraordinary photostability. Despite their potential, their use has thus far been limited to imaging research. This work has now investigated the link between CNDs' photochemical properties and their chemical structure. Electron-rich, yellow carbon nanodots (yCNDs) are obtained with in situ addition of NaOH during the synthesis, whereas otherwise electron-poor, red carbon nanodots (rCNDs) are obtained. These properties originate from the reduced and oxidized dimer of citrazinic acid within the matrix of yCNDs and rCNDs, respectively. Remarkably, yCNDs deposited on TiO2 give a 30% higher photocurrent density of 0.7 mA cm(-2) at +0.3 V versus Ag/AgCl under Xe-lamp irradiation (450 nm long-pass filter, 100 mW cm(-2)) than rCNDs. The difference in overall photoelectric performance is due to fundamentally different charge-transfer mechanisms. These depend on either the electron-accepting or the electron-donating nature of the CNDs, as is evident from photoelectrochemical tests with TiO2 and NiO and time-resolved spectroscopic measurements.

The formation of tungsten oxo-clusters and their organized transformation into few-to-multi-layered WO3 sheets occurs during the hydrolysis stage, and crystallization occurs during the post-sintering process. XRD results exhibited a phase transformation from monoclinic to orthorhombic beta-WO3 due to post sintering effects. The as-prepared material appears as self-organized few- to multi-layered WO3 sheets. The as-prepared and sintered samples are used for the photodegradation of Congo red (CR) under visible light irradiation. A sample sintered at 300 degrees C (S-300) shows much higher photocatalytic activity than the as-prepared WO3 and those sintered at 180 degrees C and 400 degrees C. The S-300 photocatalyst has the optimal performance in the removal of CR, which is due to high specific surface area and patches of crystalline sites on the photocatalyst surface. These sites can suppress the recombination of electrons and holes by accelerating the charge carrier transformation within the photocatalyst. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Next to natural gas and hydrogen, which are today's most common fuels for SOFC-systems and cell-/stack-testing respectively, various other fuels are applicable as well. In the literature, a number of promising results show that available fuels as propane, butane, ammonia, gasoline, diesel etc. can be applied. Here, the performance of an anode supported cell operated in specialized single cell test benches with different gaseous and liquid fuels and reformates thereof is presented. Fuels as ammonia, dissolved urea (AddBlue(TM)), methane/steam and ethanol/water mixtures can directly be fed to the cell, whereas propane and diesel require external reforming. It is shown that in case of a stable fuel supply the cell performance with such fuels is similar to that of appropriate mixtures of H-2, N-2, CO, CO2, and steam, if the impact of endothermic reforming or decomposition reactions is considered. Even though a stable fuel cell operation with such fuels is possible in a single cell test bench, it should be pointed out that an appropriate fuel processing will be mandatory on the system level.

In this work, we report a facile method for preparation of nitrogen-doped graphene scrolls (N-GSS) through acoustic cavitation, which can not only realize graphene nitrogen doping but also simultaneously result in its scrolled topological structure and improvement of reduction degree. As a metal-free electrocatalyst, the prepared N-GSS showed good electrocatalytic activity towards oxidation of hydrogen peroxide with the sensitivity of 87.8 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2). Then N-GSS was employed as a matrix for glucose oxidase (GOD) loading, and the fabricated biosensor also exhibited excellent analytical characteristics, such as a high sensitivity (55.2 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)), wide linear range (2 mu M to 3.56 mM, R = 0.999) and low detection limit (1 mu M).

Moreover, this article seeks to investigate the effect of doping CeNPs by plasmonic nanoparticles, as gold (AuNPs), silver (AgNPs) and platinum (PtNPs). CeNPs are obtained by a precipitation process, while the deposition precipitation using urea (DPU) method was chosen to dope the CeNPs. The physicochemical characteristics of materials have performed using various techniques such as: XRD, RD/UV-vis, FTIR, BET, and TG-DTA analysis. The photocatalytic performance of the synthesized nanomaterials was investigated in terms of their efficiency for the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) in an aqueous solution under different illumination (UVA and UVC). The degradation rates exceeding 92 % could be achieved in very short times depending on the dopant and the illumination nature. However, the corrosion inhibition properties of synthesized nanomaterials on mild steel in acid medium (hydrochloric acid, 1 N) were estimated using a weight loss method. The inhibition efficiency achieved 80-96 % and increase with concentration. It was concluded that the studied nanomaterials are a potential photocatalysts and corrosion inhibitors.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of different levels of CLO on blood parameters and antioxidant status in Afshari ewes. Six adults Afshari ewes (3-4 years old and 51 +/- 5 kg) were randomly allocated to 3x3 Latin square design with three diets in 21 days period. Dietary treatments included: 1) control diet, 2) control diet with 200 mg/day CLO, and 3) control diet with 400 mg/day CLO. To evaluate the antioxidant effect of the CLO, sustainable elimination of free radicals by DPPH and ABTS methods were used. The antioxidant activity of essential oils in DPPH method at doses of 32.5, 45, 130, 260 and 520 mg/ml were 9, 16, 31, 49 and 89%, respectively. Also, antioxidant activity of essential oils in ABTS method at doses of 32.5, 45, 130, 260 and 520 mg/ml were 49, 73, 81, 89 and 95%, respectively. CLO treatments did not affect glucose, blood urea nitrogen, albumin, total protein, low density lipoprotein, while improved the concentration of high-density lipoprotein (P>0.01). Results showed that supplementation with CLO significantly decreased (P<0.01) cholesterol, triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein concentrations compared with control. There was no significant difference in analyzed blood bio-chemicals and serum enzymes level between different antioxidant activity methods and groups, suggesting general well-being of ewes. These results suggest that, CLO supplementation had a positive impact on blood traits and antioxidant status of the Afshari ewes.

We investigated the effect of alternate drying-rewetting cycles on N2O emissions and soil microbial communities in jar experiments with soil samples. The results showed that instant flooding and air-drying moments are two important steps of soil drying and rewetting periods influencing soil microbial communities and N2O emissions. N2O fluxes in the air dry (AD) steps were always higher than those in the instant flooding (IF) steps, especially in the early stages of AD and IF. The soil treated with long-term organic matter and chemical fertilizer promoted N2O emissions but inhibited the N2O release from newly applied urea when soil went through drying and rewetting events. Soil moisture content(s) also significantly affected the growth of ammonia oxidiser and denitrifier communities, with the functional gene abundance increasing with increasing soil moisture content. While comparing first and second cycles, N2O fluxes were six times higher in the first cycle than in the second cycle. It is concluded that sudden changes in moisture condition influenced the N2O flux, and nitrifier and denitrifier functional genes by affecting the growth of ammonia oxidiser and denitrifier communities.

Nitrogen-modified perovskite type composite catalysts were prepared by hydrothermal method and then characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), temperature-programmed reductions (TPR), and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). The results revealed that nitrogen sources (urea, biuret, melamine, carbohydrazide, and semicarbazide hydrochloride) and nitrogen source addition changed the catalytic performance in physical and chemical properties, the migration of reactive species and the catalytic performance. When the addition amount of semicarbazide hydrochloride was three times that of LaCoO3, the composite catalysts had high Co3+/Co2+ (1.39) and O-ads/O-lat (15.18) and showed the best catalytic performance: the temperatures that are required for achieving methane conversion of 50% and 90% were 277 and 360 degrees C, which are more effective than noble metal oxides. Moreover, the in situ diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) were applied to elucidate the efficient for CH4 removal and also can further explain the surface reaction mechanism of the composite catalyst during the methane catalytic combustion.

GCN5L1 is a specific acetyltransferase in mitochondria, which regulates glucose and fatty acid metabolism. However, the role of GCN5L1 in mitochondrial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of ischemic AKI are not fully understood. Methods: The protein level of GCN5L1 was detected by western blot assay. Acetylated proteomics was used to explore the level of acetylated TFAM. Duolink proximity ligation assay and co-immunoprecipitation were used to detect the interaction of TFAM and translocase of outer membrane 70 (TOM70). mtDNA copy number, the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes, the number and morphology of mitochondria were measured. The renal injury of AKI mice was reflected by the levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen and the pathological changes of renal tissue. Results: We showed that GCN5L1 was highly expressed in vivo and in vitro and renal tubules specific knockdown of GCN5L1 could effectively attenuate AKI-induced mitochondrial impairment. Besides, acetylated proteomics revealed that acetylated TFAM was significantly upregulated in AKI mice kidney, which reminded us that TFAM might be an acetylating substrate of GCN5L1. Mechanistically, we evidenced that GCN5L1 could acetylate TFAM at its K76 site and subsequently inhibited its binding to TOM70, thereby reducing TFAM import into mitochondria and mitochondrial biogenesis. Clinically, GCN5L1 and acetylated TFAM were positively correlated with disease severity (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: In sum, these data demonstrated an unrecognized regulating mechanism of GCN5L1 on TFAM acetylation and its intracellular trafficking, and a potential intervening target for AKI associated mitochondrial disorders as well.

J	Kalanur, SS; Seo, H				Kalanur, Shankara S.; Seo, Hyungtak			Facile growth of compositionally tuned copper vanadate nanostructured thin films for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting	APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL												Copper vanadates are considered as one of the most promising photoanode materials for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting owing to their narrow bandgap, stoichiometry-dependent optical and electrical properties, and high stability. However, for technological applications, it is imperative to develop stoichiometrically and structurally tuned copper vanadates for improved performance. In this study, we developed a facile and one-step hydrothermal method for the synthesis of Cu2V2O7 nanoplates, Cu5V2O10 nanorods, and Cu11V6O26 micropillars on a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate without using a seed layer. The presence of urea during the hydrothermal synthesis significantly affected the film formation and morphology of the copper vanadates. The crystallographic, chemical, and electrochemical properties of the synthesized copper vanadates were investigated. The optimized Cu2V2O7, Cu5V2O10, and Cu11V5O26 electrodes exhibited the highest photocurrent densities of (similar to)0.41, 0.27, and 0.076 mA cm(-2) (at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode under 1-sun illumination) and incident photon to current efficiency values of (similar to)24%, 18%, and 7.5% (at 300 nm), respectively. The band edge positions of Cu2V2O7, Cu5V2O10, and Cu11V6O26 were estimated on the basis of the spectroscopic and electrochemical results. The synthesis scheme and valuable insights provided in this work can be used for the development of chemically and morphologically optimized copper vanadates for efficient PEC water splitting.

However, there are still problems such as easily agglomerates to form worm-like structures at high temperatures and difficult availability of spherical nanoparticles. In this study, spherical alpha-Al2O3 nanoparticies with high dispersion were prepared by a combination of a microwave hydrothermal method and an addition of nano-Al particles as seeds. First, spherical amorphous alumina precursors were synthesized by the microwave hydrothermal method at 100 degrees C for 30 min using Al-2(SO4)(3)center dot 18H(2)O, Al(NO3)(3)center dot 9H(2)O, and urea, as raw materials, and then spherical alpha-Al2O3 nanoparticles with a diameter of about 66 nm were acquired after calcined the precursor at 1050 degrees C for 90 min by adding nano-Al seeds, which reduced the calcination temperature by 50 degrees C and holding time by 30 min compared to that without seeds. Kinetic analysis shows that 5 wt.% nano-Al seeds can reduce the activation energy of crystalline transition of gamma-Al2O3 to alpha-Al2O3 from 516.51 to 474.37 kJ/mol. Moreover, the microscopic mechanism of nano-Al particles as seeds was investigated. The characterizations of sintering properties show that spherical alpha-Al2O3 nanoparticles facilitate the acquisition of uniform microstructure for resulting ceramic and the fracture modes include both intergranular and transgranular fractures.

J	Wu, B; Xiong, YQ; Ru, JB; Feng, H				Wu, Bo; Xiong, Yuanquan; Ru, Jinbo; Feng, Hao			Removal of NO from flue gas using heat-activated ammonium persulfate aqueous solution in a bubbling reactor	RSC ADVANCES												Ammonium persulfate aqueous solution was used for the first time for NO removal from flue gas in a bubbling bed due to its low cost compared with other persulfate salts (sodium persulfate, potassium persulfate and ammonium persulfate). The effects of ammonium persulfate concentration, solution temperature, initial pH value, additive concentration, NO concentration, O-2 concentration and SO2 concentration on NO removal were investigated systematically. The increased pH had a significant and negative effect on NO removal. The optimal solution temperature was 50 degrees C and increased ammonium persulfate concentration greatly promoted the NO removal efficiency. Urea showed a better performance on NO removal efficiency than ammonium hydroxide. The NO concentration and O-2 concentration affected NO removal slightly while the increased SO2 concentration weakened NO removal efficiency. NO generation in alkaline ammonium persulfate aqueous solution was detected. The detection of free radicals in ammonium persulfate solution using the HPLC method and the effect of O-2 concentration on NO generation was carried out with the initial pH value increased. Due to the reducibility of ammonia, the solution pH and O-2 concentration in the flue gas were proven to play a major role in NO generation using ammonium persulfate. The NO generation mechanism and the possible reactions in the aqueous solution were elucidated and speculated. The experimental results indicated that the proposed technology using heat-activated ammonia persulfate in acidic aqueous solution might be a feasible method for the NO removal from flue gas.

For this purpose, eco-friendly efficient photocatalysts are urgently required. This work focuses on the synthesis and characterization of nitrogen-doped porous carbon/ZnO nanorod arrays (PC/ZnO NRs) as a photo-degradation catalyst. Using absorbent cotton as a carbon source, nitrogen doped porous carbon was obtained by urea decomposition during the carbonization process of cotton at set temperatures. ZnO NRs were grown on the porous carbon to form the PC/ZnO NR hybrid. The prepared samples were systematically characterized, and their photo-catalysis capability was evaluated by the degradation process of rhodamine B (RhB). It is found that PC500/ZnO NRs demonstrated an efficient photo-catalysis under Xe lamp irradiation, such that over 96.5% of RhB (10 ppm) could be photo-degraded within 20 min with 10 mg. The mechanism is discussed based on the tight interfacial bonding and the appropriate Fermi energy between porous carbon and ZnO NRs, which enhanced the separation efficiency of photo-generated charge carriers and provided an ultrahigh density of catalytic reaction centers. Overall, this green and scalable fabrication technology will provide new insights into a reasonable design for high performance photo-catalysts and environmental pollutant management.

The elemental analysis of synthesized compound has carried out by H-1-NMR and C-13-NMR rotational spectra. The vibrational (FT-IR, FT-Raman) spectra were investigated in the visible range (4000-400 and 3500-50 cm(-1)) and the electronic excitation in BCOP was studied by UV-Visible (200 -800 nm) spectrum. In addition to that to support the observed results and explore the insights of BCOP, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed on rotational, vibrational and transitional states of BCOP. The results obtained by experiments and computations on BCOP were compared and the consequences were discussed in detail. The NLO property was measured in terms of first hyperpolarizability (beta(0)), the first hyperpolarizability of BCOP is twenty one times greater than reference molecule (urea). Besides that the intra-molecular charge transfers between the natural bonding orbitals (NBO) were estimated using NBO analysis.

Compared to conventional Pt/C electrodes under the same conditions, the proposed nanocatalyst shows closer onset potential and current density. Typically, the observed onset potentials and current densities for the synthesized and Pt/C electrodes are 825 and 910 mV (vs. NHE) and -3.65 and -4.31 mA.cm(-2) (at 5 mV.s(-1)), respectively. However, the most important advantage of the introduced metallic alloy-decorated graphene is its distinct stability in acid medium; the retention in the electrocatalytic performance after 1,000 successive cycles is approximately 98%. This finding is attributed to the high corrosion resistance of the NiFe alloy. The kinetic study indicates that the number of the transferred electrons is 3.46 and 3.89 for the introduced and Pt/C (20 wt%) electrodes, respectively which concludes a high activity for the proposed nanocomposite. The suggested decorated graphene can be synthesized using a multi-thermal method. Typically, nickel acetate, iron acetate, graphene oxide and urea are subjected to MW heating. Then, sintering with melamine in an Argon atmosphere at 750 degrees C is required to produce the final electrocatalyst. Overall, the introduced NiFe@N-doped Gr nanocomposite shows remarkable electrochemical activity in the acid medium with long-term stability.					Barakat, Nasser/JFK-0357-2023; G.

In this work, a lanthanum carbonate grafted ZSM-5 adsorbent (LC-ZSM-5) was prepared and optimized by a BoxBehnken design. The higher temperature, molar ratio of urea to lanthanum and initial lanthanum concentration are beneficial for LC-ZSM-5 synthesis, and the adsorption capacity of LC-ZSM-5 under optimistic conditions was 91.2 mg-PO43-/g. The growth mechanism indicates that the LC particles grow larger with synthesis time and finally agglomerate, and 12 h is the best synthesis time. The thermodynamic results show that phosphate adsorption over LC-ZSM-5 is a spontaneously exothermic and combined physicochemical adsorption process. Kinetic studies suggest that higher temperatures help increase the phosphate adsorption rate, and chemical adsorption plays an important role during adsorption with an activation energy Ea of 42.7 kJ/mol. The adsorption mechanism of the phosphate uptake process includes electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange, through which LC is changed to lanthanum phosphate (LP) during adsorption. Finally, the regeneration study revealed that LC-ZSM-5 still exhibited a high adsorption capacity after 5 cycles, showing its satisfactory regeneration ability and potential industrial application.					lin, haowen/IQW-3705-2023; Bao, Lulu/LKN-3865-2024	lin, haowen/0000-0003-0610-4014; Zheng, ChenYang/0000-0002-8427-8194; Yang, Yi/0000-0003-2797-8298													1385-8947	1873-3212				FEB 15	2022	430		4						133166	10.1016/j.cej.2021.133166	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.133166		DEC 2021											WOS:000740946900003

Nevertheless, the practical applications of Li-S batteries are significantly limited by the shuttle effect and sluggish sulfur redox reaction (SROR) kinetics. Herein, an ingenious urea-mediated pyrolysis strategy is for the first time reported to obtain well-defined atomically distributed asymmetrical five-coordinated Co-N-5 moieties anchored on nitrogen-rich (30.0 at%) doped carbon (CoN5 SA/NC) as a highly efficient SROR electrocatalyst. CoN5 SA/NC with a high atomically distributed Co loading (2.12 wt%) effectively catalyzes the liquid-liquid and liquid-solid conversions of lithium polysulfides greatly accelerating the SROR kinetics. When CoN5 SA/NC is served as a coating layer for the separator, the Li-S battery exhibits outstanding capacity properties (1060 mA h g(-1) at 1C and 922 mA h g(-1) at 2C) and superior cycling stability (ultralow decay of 0.033% per cycle at 3C for 1600 cycles). An ultrahigh areal capacity of 7.25 mA h cm(-2) can be acquired for the CoN5 SA/NC based Li-S battery even with a high sulfur loading of 6.5 mg cm(-2). Obviously, the asymmetrical single-atom site engineering strategy demonstrates great potential for practical applications of advanced metal-S batteries.

The catalyst obtained by this approach significantly promoted PMS activation and enhanced the degradation efficiency of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP). Experiments and theoretical calculations showed that the introduction of carbon not only narrowed the band gap, but also accelerated the separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, which greatly improved the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4. In the degradation of pollutants, free radicals and non-free radicals acted simultaneously, with non-free radicals playing a dominant role. This study explained the origin of 1O2 by Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, visible light excited photocatalysts to form holes, while carbon introduction decreased the valence-electron density around the area, inducing electron transfer from PMS toward g-C3N4 directed to generate 1O2. The 1O2-dominated degradation process improved the application of the catalysts in complex aqueous matrices. In addition, we proposed 4-CP degradation pathways, and the toxicity of intermediates derived from 4-CP degradation process reduced.					wang, kun/LVR-9889-2024; Cui, Minshu/KHY-5047-2024														1385-8947	1873-3212				AUG 1	2024	493								152482	10.1016/j.cej.2024.152482	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.152482		MAY 2024											WOS:001247212600001

Hence, it is particularly important and emergency to design photocatalyst with both high activity and stability to perform high-efficiency hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, we report a competitive coordination strategy to modulate the electron and band structure of g-C3N4 dramatically improving the HER kinetics. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations results inferred that the modified g-C3N4 by copolymerizing urea and diaminodiphenyl sulfone can promote the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, and simultaneously significantly increase the fluorescence lifetime of g-C3N4. Specifically, the hydrogen generation rate is 3.7 or 9.6 folds higher of the original carbon nitride at lambda > 400 nm and lambda > 420 nm, respectively. Additionally, the optimal catalyst exhibits a high apparent quantum yield (7.02%) when the incident wavelength is 420 nm as well as excellent stability. This work will shed a spick-and-span insight for conception and preparation of high-powered metal-free photocatalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Series of hybrid monolith (GO/CNFs) were assembled via urea assisted self-assembly method. Hybridmaterials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transforminfrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction patterns, Raman spectroscopy, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric curve analysis, specific surface area, surface charge density measurement, and compressional mechanical analysis. It was proposed that strong chemical interaction (mainly hydrogen bonding) was responsible for the formation of hybrid assembly. GO/CNFs monolith showed mechanically robust architecture with tunable pore structure and surface properties. GO/CNFs adsorbent could completely remove trace to moderate concentrations of MB dye and follow pseudo-second-order kinetics model. Adsorption isotherm behaviors were found in the following order: Langmuir isotherm > Freundlich isotherm > Temkin isotherm model. Maximum adsorption capacity of 227.27 mg g(-1) was achieved which is much higher than reported graphene based monoliths and magnetic adsorbent. Incorporation of nanocellulose follows exponential relationship with dye uptake capacities. High surface charge density and specific surface area were main dye adsorptive mechanism. Regeneration and recycling efficiency was achieved up to four consecutive cycles with cost-effective recollection and zero recontamination of treated water.

Although many microbial metabolites of IPU are known and IPU-mineralizing bacteria have been isolated, the molecular mechanism of IPU catabolism has not been elucidated yet. In this study, complete genes that encode the conserved IPU catabolic pathway were revealed, based on comparative analysis of the genomes of three IPU-mineralizing sphingomonads and subsequent experimental validation. The complete genes included a novel hydrolase gene ddhA, which is responsible for the cleavage of the urea side chain of the IPU demethylated products; a distinct aniline dioxygenase gene cluster adoQTA1A2BR, which has a broad substrate range; and an inducible catechol meta-cleavage pathway gene cluster adoXEGKLIJC. Furthermore, the initial mono-N-demethylation genes pdmAB were further confirmed to be involved in the successive N-demethylation of the IPU mono-N-demethylated product. These IPU-catabolic genes were organized into four transcription units and distributed on three plasmids. They were flanked by multiple mobile genetic elements and highly conserved among IPUmineralizing sphingomonads. The elucidation of the molecular mechanism of IPU catabolism will enhance our understanding of the microbial mineralization of IPU and provide insights into the evolutionary scenario of the conserved IPU-catabolic pathway.

Postbiotic yeast fermentation product supplementation to lactating goats increases the efficiency of milk production by enhancing fiber digestibility and ruminal propionate, and reduces energy losses in methane	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												Lay Summary Although in vitro data with mixed ruminal fluid demonstrated positive effects of postbiotics from lactobacilli on measures of fermentation and microbial profiles, there is a paucity of in vivo data with lactating ruminants. We evaluated the effects of incorporating a postbiotic yeast fermentation product in diets of lactating goats on energy partitioning, carbon and nitrogen balance, and performance. The postbiotic led to greater ruminal propionate concentration and fiber digestibility, and decreased partitioning of energy to methane. Those changes were associated with greater milk production. Data suggested that postbiotics could enhance efficiency of nutrient use for milk production. Although in vitro data with mixed ruminal fluid demonstrated positive effects of posbiotic diet (POS) from lactobacilli on measures of fermentation and microbial profiles, there is a paucity of in vivo data with lactating ruminants. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of incorporating POS into diets of lactating goats on energy (E) partitioning, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) balance, and performance. Ten late-lactation Murciano-Granadina goats were used in a crossover design with 26-d periods. Goats in the control diet (CON) were fed daily at the rate of 1 kg alfalfa hay and 1.5 kg concentrate, and the treatment group (POS) was fed CON with the addition of 3.75 g/d of Probisan Ruminants (PENTABIOL S.L., Navarra, Spain). No differences in DMI were detected. However, ruminal fluid propionate and apparent total tract digestibilities of NDF and ADF were greater (18%, 4.7%, and 5.2%, respectively; P < 0.05) in POS compared with the CON diet. Daily partitioning of E to milk and efficiency of ME intake for milk production greater (11% and 3.0%, respectively; P < 0.05) in POS compared with CON. The nonprotein RQ was greater in POS compared with CON due to greater (P < 0.05) oxidation of carbohydrate (213 vs. 115 kJ/kg of BW0.75 per day) compared with fat (362 vs. 486 kJ/kg of BW0.75 per day). Although no differences were found in C balance, goats in POS had lower (P < 0.05) amounts of C in CH4 (1.1 vs. 1.3 g/kg BW0.75 per day) compared with CON. There were no differences in N intake or N in feces or urine, but N in milk was greater (P < 0.05) in POS compared with the CON diet (0.8 vs. 0.7 g/kg BW0.75 per day). Yield of fat-corrected milk (FCM) (3.20 vs. 2.72 kg/d; P < 0.05) and concentration of true protein (3.4 vs. 3.3 kg/d; P < 0.05) and lactose (4.7 vs. 4.5 kg/d; P < 0.05) were greater in POS compared with CON. These responses were accompanied by lower (P < 0.05) urea (12.3 vs. 16.6 mM/L) and ammonia-N (6.6 vs. 8.8 mg/L) without changes in fat concentration (6.1% vs. 6.0%; P > 0.05) in POS compared with the CON diet. Daily amount of CH4 emission did not differ P > 0.05 between diets. However, when expressed relative to unit of edible product, feeding POS reduced (P < 0.05) the amount of CH4 by 46 g/kg of milk fat, 97 g/kg of milk protein, and 3 g/kg of milk compared with CON. Overall, data indicated that feeding a postbiotic in late-lactation increased energy efficiency for milk production partly by reducing CH4 emission. Our results demonstrate that feeding a postbiotic in late-lactation can increase energy efficiency for milk production in part by enhancing ruminal production of propionate and reducing methane emission.

Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) and Field Emission Transmission Electron Microscopy (FE-TEM) are used to analyze the morphology of MWCNT/CuO nanostructures. The elemental analyses of nanostructures are determined by FESEM-EDS, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The as-prepared MWCNT/CuO is tested as an electrocatalyst for OER. The MWCNT/CuO catalyst exhibits a lower onset potential of 1.55 V vs RHE as compared to Cu(OH)(2) (1.57 V) and MWCNT/Cu(OH)(2) (1.65 V). Moreover, the catalyst has shown the lower Tafel slope value of 59.9 mVdec(-1) in comparison with Cu(OH)(2) 78.9 mVdec(-1) and MWCNT/Cu(OH)(2) 127.9 mVdec(-1).

Herein, BiOX photocatalysts were prepared in various solvents, including deionized water, glacial acetic acid, ethylene glycol, glycerol, urea solution, N, N-dimethylformamide, methanol and ethanol, at room temperature while keeping other reaction conditions identical. Their microstructure and band structure were characterized by XRD, SEM, DRS, Mott-Schottky curves, etc. And photocatalytic performance was assessed by using tetracycline (TC), rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) as simulated pollutants under both visible and ultraviolet (UV) light illumination. The results indicated that the effect of solvent-induced microstructures, such as morphology, particle size (specific surface areas) and facet exposure ratio, on photocatalytic performance of three BiOX is in the same change order. Whereas, the change of their band potentials is relatively inconsistent. Among the studied solvents, BiOX prepared in ethylene glycol (EG) showed the best photocatalytic activity, and those prepared in aqueous solution demonstrated the worst photocatalytic performance. In addition, for BiOX prepared in the same solvent, BiOCl and BiOBr exhibited higher photocatalytic activity for TC and RhB degradation than BiOI, whereas, they showed reversed trend for MO degradation.

The synthesis parameters were investigated by a series of controled experiments. It is found that molar ratio, initial concentration of CuCl2 and NaH2PO4, and surfactant species were crucial factors determining the formation and morphology of Cu-2(OH)PO4 center dot Cu-2(OH)PO4 synthesized at different [PO43-] (n(Cu)/n(P)=2) exhibited a various morphologies including grain-like, prism and long-prismatic. Addition of anionic surfactant and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) greatly affects Cu-2(OH)PO4 final morphology. The photocatalytic degradation of Cu-2(OH)PO4 on methylene blue (MB) was evaluated with addition of H2O2 under visible light irradiation. The results showed that Cu-2(OH)PO4 synthesized at conditions when n(Cu)/n(P)=2, [PO43-]=0.0025 mol/L, 6.0 g urea and 0.10 g SDS, microwave heating at 80 degrees C for 30 min exhibited best visible-light photo-degradation activity. The increase in HO center dot formation in the presence of Cu-2(OH)PO4 and the inhibition of HO center dot generation by adding HO center dot scavengers (t-butanol) indicated that HO center dot generated in the reaction system was responsible for the enhanced MB decomposition. Cu-2(OH)PO4 exhibited excellent stability and effectiveness after 5 consecutive runs in terms of photodegradation of MB.

Comparing DNA, RNA and protein levels for measuring microbial dynamics in soil microcosms amended with nitrogen fertilizer	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												To what extent multi-omic techniques could reflect in situ microbial process rates remains unclear, especially for highly diverse habitats like soils. Here, we performed microcosm incubations using sandy soil from an agricultural site in Midwest USA. Microcosms amended with isotopically labeled ammonium and urea to simulate a fertilization event showed nitrification (up to 4.1 +/- 0.87 mu g N-NO3- g(-1) dry soil d(-1)) and accumulation of N2O after 192 hours of incubation. Nitrification activity (NH4+-> NH2OH -> NO -> NO2--> NO3-) was accompanied by a 6-fold increase in relative expression of the 16S rRNA gene (RNA/DNA) between 10 and 192 hours of incubation for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira, unlike archaea and comammox bacteria, which showed stable gene expression. A strong relationship between nitrification activity and betaproteobacterial ammonia monooxygenase and nitrite oxidoreductase transcript abundances revealed that mRNA quantitatively reflected measured activity and was generally more sensitive than DNA under these conditions. Although peptides related to housekeeping proteins from nitrite-oxidizing microorganisms were detected, their abundance was not significantly correlated with activity, revealing that metaproteomics provided only a qualitative assessment of activity. Altogether, these findings underscore the strengths and limitations of multi-omic approaches for assessing diverse microbial communities in soils and provide new insights into nitrification.

J	Reijngoud, DJ				Reijngoud, D-J			Flux analysis of inborn errors of metabolism	JOURNAL OF INHERITED METABOLIC DISEASE												Patients with an inborn error of metabolism (IEM) are deficient of an enzyme involved in metabolism, and as a consequence metabolism reprograms itself to reach a new steady state. This new steady state underlies the clinical phenotype associated with the deficiency. Hence, we need to know the flux of metabolites through the different metabolic pathways in this new steady state of the reprogrammed metabolism. Stable isotope technology is best suited to study this. In this review the progress made in characterizing the altered metabolism will be presented. Studies done in patients to estimate the residual flux through the metabolic pathway affected by enzyme deficiencies will be discussed. After this, studies done in model systems will be reviewed. The focus will be on glycogen storage disease type I, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, propionic and methylmalonic aciduria, urea cycle defects, phenylketonuria, and combined D,L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria.

In this work, we illustrate a CO-assisted mechanism by combining experimental and kinetic modeling studies. Pd/SSZ-13 has been synthesized, characterized and evaluated as a PNA in low-temperature NOx adsorption and temperature program desorption cycles, to represent multiple cold start periods. The gas compositions were also systemically changed, where both the effect of varying NOx and CO feed was evaluated in the presence of high water and oxygen contents. A kinetic model was developed to simulate the profiles of NO and NO2, including three initial Pd sites (Z-Pd(II)Z-, Z-[Pd(II)OH]+ and PdO). It is concluded from XPS and in situ DRIFTS experiments, flow reactor measurements and modelling observations that CO reduces Pd(II) species to Pd(I)/Pd(0) species, which increases the stability of the stored NOx species, resulting in a release above the urea dosing temperature. The model could well describe the experimental features, including the effect of CO. In addition, the model was used for full-scale catalytic converter simulations.

In this work, by incorporation of different deep eutectic solvents (DESs), ZnO nanoparticles, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes(MWCNTs) into the carbon paste matrix, and electropolymerization of arginine at the resulted electrode, new sensor was designed for improved sensing of acyclovir. The effect of influential factors on the electrode quality was investigated. As a result, the carbon paste electrode modified with 5% ZnO, 5% MWCNTs, 5% DES (choline chloride-urea) and applying10 cycles in polymeric condition exerted remarkable enhancement for acyclovir in physiological media (pH = 7). Two linear ranges have been obtained for the acyclovir concentration within the ranges of 0.01-0.33 and 0.33-1.0 mu M, with a detection limit of 0.007 mu M. The excellent selectivity of sensor for the acyclovir determination was confirmed by discrimination of peaks for interferences (e.g. ascorbic acid, and guanine). Suitability of the fabricated sensor for acyclovir determination in pharmaceutical formulations and human fluid was confirmed with satisfactory results.

Natural plants have become a hotspot in the research and application of substituting AGPs because of their advantages of safety, efficiency, and availability. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of Macleaya cordata extract (MCE) in the diet of Xuefeng black-bone chicken on laying performance, egg quality, and serum indices. In this study, 576 birds (47-week-old) were evenly distributed between 4 treatments with 6 replicates of 24 hens each. The control group was fed a basal diet without MCE and the remaining groups received 100, 150, or 200 mg/kg MCE for 84 d. Results revealed that the strength and thickness of the eggshell increased significantly with the dietary addition of MCE (P < 0.05). The serum concentrations of glutathione peroxidase increased in the MCE groups (P < 0.01). Simultaneously, progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone, estradiol as well as serum luteinizing hormone levels also increased with the addition of MCE (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, supplementation of MCE significantly decreased the tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 levels (P < 0.01). In summary, it was concluded that diet addition of 200 mg/kg MCE ameliorated egg quality, enhanced antioxidation and immune activity, and regulated hormone secretion of Xuefeng black-bone chicken.					杨, 晨/GXN-1628-2022; Liu, Lulu/GXZ-9653-2022; He, Changqing/HPH-5111-2023															1525-3171				APR	2021	100	4							101031	10.1016/j.psj.2021.101031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2021.101031								33684648					WOS:000637971200002

GQDs obtained from citric acids made them rich in carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, giving GQDs the ability to combine with lead ions. As anticipated, the fluorescence intensity was quenched by Pb2+ through electron transfer process. Further, the addition of D-PA effectively recovered the fluorescence due to the departure of Pb2+ from GQDs aroused by the strong coordination between D-PA and Pb2+. Thus, a fluorescent switch was activated for D-PA detection. The fluorescence recovery efficiencies were found to be proportional to the concentration of D-PA in the range of 0.6-50 mu mol L-1 and the detection limit was 0.47 mu mol L-1. The real sample detection was performed in human urea sample and satisfactory recoveries of 96.84%-102.13% were obtained. The GQDs-Pb2+ based fluorescent switch sensing method was firstly established with low detection limit and wide linear range, making it a supplement and improvement for D-PA detection.

J	Ramachandran, S; Sivasamy, A				Ramachandran, Saranya; Sivasamy, Arumugam			Synthesis of nanocrystalline bismuth oxide and its visible photocatalytic activity in the degradation of an organic dye	INORGANIC AND NANO-METAL CHEMISTRY												Bismuth oxide powder was synthesized, characterized and employed as a visible light photocatalyst for the degradation of aqueous solutions of Orange G (OG), a mono azo dye that is a commonly used colouring agent in various industrial applications. A simple combustion method using urea as fuel was employed to synthesize the metal oxide nanopowders. The prepared material was found to be nanocrystalline in nature as confirmed by XRD analysis. The band gap energy of the material is calculated by plotting (Ah nu)(2) vs. h nu from the UV-DRS spectrum and it is found to be 2.7 eV. The surface morphology and roughness of the material was studied by FE-SEM and AFM techniques. XPS and EDAX studies confirmed the elemental purity and presence in the nanomaterial. Preliminary studies were carried out in order to optimize the solution pH, catalyst dosage and initial dye concentration. As the catalyst possessed good activity at all pH values, thereafter all the photocatalytic reactions were carried out at neutral pH to make the process less cumber-some and cost effective. An optimum catalyst dosage of 1.5 g/L was fixed for a dye solution of 5 mg/L concentration. Kinetic studies showed the photo-degradation to follow pseudo-first order kinetics. Studies on the effect of electrolytes in solution showed that there was a decrease in the efficiency of the catalyst in the presence of the electrolytes. Reusability studies were performed on the catalyst to estimate the economic viability of the system.

Nitrogen Metabolism Genes from Temperate Marine Sediments	MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY												In this study, we analysed metagenomes along with biogeochemical profiles from Skagerrak (SK) and Bothnian Bay (BB) sediments, to trace the prevailing nitrogen pathways. NO3 (-) was present in the top 5 cm below the sediment-water interface at both sites. NH4 (+) increased with depth below 5 cm where it overlapped with the NO3 (-) zone. Steady-state modelling of NO3 (-) and NH4 (+) porewater profiles indicates zones of net nitrogen species transformations. Bacterial protease and hydratase genes appeared to make up the bulk of total ammonification genes. Genes involved in ammonia oxidation (amo, hao), denitrification (nir, nor), dissimilatory NO3 (-) reduction to NH4 (+) (nfr and otr) and in both of the latter two pathways (nar, nap) were also present. Results show ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are similarly abundant in both sediments. Also, denitrification genes appeared more abundant than DNRA genes. 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that the relative abundance of the nitrifying group Nitrosopumilales and other groups involved in nitrification and denitrification (Nitrobacter, Nitrosomonas, Nitrospira, Nitrosococcus and Nitrosomonas) appeared less abundant in SK sediments compared to BB sediments. Beggiatoa and Thiothrix 16S rRNA genes were also present, suggesting chemolithoautotrophic NO3 (-) reduction to NO2 (-) or NH4 (+) as a possible pathway. Our results show the metabolic potential for ammonification, nitrification, DNRA and denitrification activities in North Sea and Baltic Sea sediments.

Recent evidence has revealed an emerging role for ferroptosis in the pathophysiology of acute kidney injury (AKI). Sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein highly expressed in the renal cortex. However, the effects of SQOR on ferroptosis and AKI have not been elucidated. In this study, we evaluated the effects of SQOR in several AKI models. We observed a rapid decrease in SQOR expression after cisplatin stimulation in both in vivo and in vitro models. SQOR-deletion mice exhibit exacerbated kidney impairment and ferroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells following cisplatin injury. Additionally, our results showed that the overexpression of SQOR or ADT-OH (the slow-releasing H2S donor) preserved renal function in the three AKI mouse models. These effects were evidenced by lower levels of serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), renal neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1). Importantly, SQOR knockout significantly aggravates cisplatin-induced ferroptosis by promoting mitochondrial dysfunction in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs). Moreover, online database analysis combined with our study revealed that SYVN1, an upregulated E3 ubiquitin ligase, may mediate the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of SQOR in AKI. Consequently, our results suggest that SYVN1-mediated ubiquitination degradation of SQOR may induce mitochondrial dysfunction in RTECs, exacerbating ferroptosis and thereby promoting the occurrence and development of AKI. Hence, targeting the SYVN1-SQOR axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy for AKI treatment.					zhan, pengsongzhan/MFJ-8806-2025	Li, Dangran/0000-0002-4771-8138													2213-2317					FEB	2024	69								102973	10.1016/j.redox.2023.102973	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2023.102973		DEC 2023						38052107					WOS:001131776400001

In this study, hybrid polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets (PCN) with highly dispersed Fe(III) active sites (denoted as Fe-UCN, which UCN stands for PCN with urea as precursor) was synthesized to degrade PPCPs, and Fe-UCN was further entrapped (denoted as CAlg/Fe-UCN) to serve as a fixed-bed reactor to increase the treatment scale and achieve continuous photo-oxidization under white LED light. The Fe-UCN possessed the 2D layered nanosheet, and abundant Fe(III) species interacted with the unsaturated coordination N atom as the active sites. When compared to pristine UCN, the Fe-UCN had higher oxidizing ability to sulfamethoxazole due to the increasing visible-light sensitivity, boosted charge carrier concentration and high separation efficiency of the electron-hole pairs without leakage of Fe(III) species from Fe-UCN. The degradation pathway mainly included SN breakage, hydroxyl substitution and oxazole ring opening processes. The Fe-UCN could also achieve simultaneous removal of sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen and trimethoprim with 1 mg L-1 of initial concentration, respectively, and the continuous-flow fixed-bed photoreactor containing CAlg/Fe-UCN could remove 2 mg L-1 of sulfamethoxazole. The photodegradation of PPCPs by the system under LED light without supplement of H2O2 and long-term reusability suggest the great potential of the developed photocatalysts for wastewater treatment.

Catalyst's electronic structure can be tuned by a simple anion doping strategy to enhance the catalytic properties. In this work, different atomic percentages of Cl? doped into CuO lattices were synthesized using deep eutectic solvent (DES) by increasing the molar ratio of choline chloride to urea. Here, DES act as a green solvent and, Cl? source in preparing catalysts. Further, catalysts' crystallinity and surface properties were analyzed through X-ray diffractometer and transmission electron microscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the presence of Cl? dopant in CuO lattices. Synthesized catalysts were studied for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and tetracycline photocatalytic degradation. Among the synthesized electrocatalysts, 2.48 at% of Cl-doped CuO catalyst displays optimum HER activity in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte with an overpotential of 400 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel value of 89 mV dec-1. Moreover, the same catalyst shows 83.5% degradation of tetracycline in 240 min under the illumination of a 35 W Xe arc lamp.

Here, a 3D nanocomposite photocatalyst g-C3N4/La-N-TiO2 (CN/La-N-TiO2) was successfully synthesized by a simple and reproducible in-situ synthetic method. The obtained composite was characterized by XRD, SEM, BET, TEM, mapping, IR, and UV-vis spectra. The photocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin was investigated by using CN/La-N-TiO2 nanocomposite. The main influential factors such as pH of the solution, initial CIP concentration, catalyst dosage, and coexisting ions were investigated in detail. The fastest degradation of CIP occurred at a pH of about 6.5, and CIP (5 mg/L starting concentration) was completely degraded in about 60 min after exposure to the simulated solar light. The removal rates were rarely affected by Na+ (10 mg center dot L-1), Ca2+ (10 mg center dot L-1), Mg2+ (10 mg center dot L-1), and urea (5 mg center dot L-1), but decreased in the presence of NO3- (10 mg center dot L-1). The findings indicate that CN/La-N-TiO2 nanocomposite is a green and promising photocatalyst for large-scale applications and would be a candidate for the removal of the emerging antibiotics present in the water environment.

In this work, a detailed study on the electrodeposition process of CoNi in a biocompatible deep eutectic solvent (DES) is presented. Alloy plating performed in choline chloride within a urea-based DES allowed us to tailor elemental compositions, morphol-ogies, and size of the deposits based on the plating conditions. Homogeneous, continuous, and needle-shaped deposits were characterized using electrochemical methods and ex-situ characterization techniques. Although the process's electrochemical behavior corresponded to that of normal deposition, applying the most negative potentials produced a co-reduction of the solvent, which favored the incorporation of oxygen species into the deposit. Given the materials' nature, morphology, and composition tailored to the high active surface, the ma-terials were tested as platforms to activate the formation of sulfate radicals from the peroxomonosulfate salt. Results related to the proposed material and preparation method were promising, as, confirmed by the high effectiveness in degrading the antibiotic tetracycline. Altogether, the work showcases a versatile, environmen-tally friendly route for electrodepositing CoNi in DESs to yield a proactive tool for developing of platforms with catalytic potential.

John			Visible-light-induced photocatalytic performances of ZnO-CuO nanocomposites for degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol	CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS												Nanostructured ZnO and CuO, and coupled oxides, i.e., ZnCu, Zn2Cu, and ZnCu2, with ZnO:CuO molar ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 1:2, respectively, were successfully prepared through a simple, one-step, microwave-assisted urea-nitrate combustion synthesis, without the use of organic solvents or surfactants. The prepared samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The optical absorption of ZnO extended into the visible region after CuO loading. The photocatalytic activities of ZnO, CuO, and the coupled oxides were evaluated based on photodegradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol under visible-light irradiation. The coupled metal oxide Zn2Cu showed the best photocatalytic activity; this was mainly attributed to the extended photoresponsive range and the increased charge separation rate in the nanocomposite. The photocatalytic degradation process obeyed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The results suggest that the coupled metal oxide Zn2Cu has potential applications as an efficient catalytic material with high efficiency and recyclability for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation.

Production of 3D-printed disposable electrochemical sensors for glucose detection using a conductive filament modified with nickel microparticles	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA												Three-dimensional printing techniques have been widely used in the fabrication of new materials applied to energy, sensing and electronics due to unique advantages, such as fast prototyping, reduced waste generation, and multiple fabrication designs. In this paper, the production of a conductive 3D-printing filament composed of Ni(OH)(2) microparticles and graphene within a polylactic acid matrix (NiG-PLA) is reported. The nanocomposite was characterized by thermogravimetric, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic, scanning electronic microscopic, Raman spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. Characteristics such as printability (using fused deposition modelling), electrical conductivity and mechanical stability of the polymer nanocomposite were evaluated before and after 3D printing. The novel 3D-printed disposable electrode was applied for selective detection of glucose (enzyme-less sensor) with a detection limit of 2.4 mmol L-1, free from the interference of ascorbic acid, urea and uric acid, compounds typically found in biological samples. The sensor was assembled in a portable electrochemical system that enables fast (160 injection h(-1)), precise (RSD < 5%) and selective determination of glucose without the need of enzymes (electrocatalytic properties of the Ni-G-PLA nanocomposite).

J	Silva, JHDE; Verruma-Bernardi, MR; de Oliveira, AL				do Nascimento e Silva, Joao Henrique; Verruma-Bernardi, Marta Regina; de Oliveira, Alessandra Lopes			Cachaca Production in Brazil and its Main Contaminant (Ethyl Carbamate)	SCIENTIA AGRICOLA												This review aims to demonstrate the possible formation of Ethyl carbamate (EC) in different production stages of cachaca. EC is a carcinogen confirmed in animal experiments and possibly carcinogenic to humans. EC incidence below relevant health limits naturally affects many fermented foods and beverages. Concentrations above 1 mg L-1 are often detected in certain spirits derived from cyanogenic plants. In Brazil, cachaca is widely consumed and therefore consumers are at health risk if they drink EC beverages at high concentrations, since the amount of EC in cachaca (sugar cane brandy) constantly exceeds the threshold 0.21 mg L-1, damaging the health of consumers and hindering exportation to North America and Europe. Many studies have reported on EC formation at different stages of the cachaca production process. Most studies refer to EC formation during fermentation and distillation. In fermentation, reaction occurs between ethanol and nitrogen precursors, such as urea (H2NCONH2) and cyanide (CN-) to form EC. In distillation, cupric ions catalyze cyanide conversion from EC; however, in discontinuous distillation, the bottling fraction of cachaca reduced EC concentration. Although this review describes the possible routes of EC formation at different production stages of cachaca, it presents some studies on EC reduction in alcoholic beverages.

Nutritional intake and anthropometric changes of professional road cyclists during a 4-day competition	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS												Appropriate nutrition through adequate dietary intake of total calories, macronutrients, and micronutrients is an essential component of optimizing the performance of all elite athletes. The aim of this study was to describe the food intake, body composition, and biochemical profile of professional cyclists during the Tour of Andalusia, a four-stage race covering a total distance of 647.6km. Nutritional data were collected by trained investigators who weighed all of the food and fluid ingested by the cyclists. The nutritional intake of the cyclists was as follows: CHO, 12.8 +/- 1.7g/kg of body weight (BW; 62.3%); fat, 2.1 +/- 0.2g/kg BW (23.2%); proteins, 3.0 +/- 0.3g/kg BW (14.5%); total kcal was 5644.3 +/- 593.1. Intake of all micronutrients, except for folate and potassium [which were 93.7% and 91.3% of Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA)] exceeded the RDA/I. Percentage of body fat and fat weight significantly decreased (P<0.05) while weight of muscle mass remained unchanged after the Tour. Concentrations of urea, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, myoglobin, and high-density lipoproteins significantly increased (P<0.05) after the Tour. To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe both nutritional intake and the body and biochemical composition of a sample of professional road cyclists during a top-class cycling race.

Multiple environmental factors (such as water, pH, and Eh) played a role in the control of Cd mobility and bioavailability. In this study, we investigated the influence of the solar irradiation on the photodissolution of synthetic CdS-montmorillonite composites (CdS-M) in solution and the stability of Cd in natural soil. The release kinetic of Cd2+ showed that after the irradiation of simulated sunlight, CdS-M composites became less stable compared to the dark control. The solar irradiation seemed to enhance the release of Cd2+ from CdS significantly and continuously. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and quenching experiments confirmed that the photogenerated holes, center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH, were possibly involved in the photo-induced release of Cd2+, while the holes was primarily responsible for the reaction. Irradiation under alkaline solution or the presence of DOM, PO43-, CO32-, and urea markedly inhibited the photodissolution process of CdS. The photo-mediated activation of Cd was further confirmed in paddy soil under natural sunlight, with a nearly threefold increase in concentration of extractable Cd during the 15 days of irradiation. This study highlights the importance of photochemical transformation of Cd in the environmental water and soil.

The epidemic spread of these pathogens has a severe threat to human health and the ecological environment. The traditional sewage sterilization methods usually produce harmful by-products and have high energy consumption. These weaknesses restrict the quality of the purified water and economic benefits. Herein, we elaborately fabricated a triboelectric nanogenerator driving nanowires electrode array (T-NEA) system for removing bacteria in the urine. An irreversible electroporation damage results in high-efficiency bacteria inactivation. The sterilization efficiency of T-NEA system is more than 99.9999% in artificial urine contaminated by Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). Those bacteria could cause epidemic infection in hospital. The electroporation effect on the bacterial membrane was confirmed by SEM imaging and confocal laser scanning microscopy. In addition, it was demonstrated that the radical oxygen species accompanied by T-NEA working could degrade the organic components in artificial urine. After being treated by T-NEA for 30 mins, the reduction rates of the total organic carbon and total nitrogen in the artificial urine reached up to 30.41% and 33.79%. Meanwhile, the degradation degree of urea, uric acid, and creatinine reached 37.39%, 30.50%, 6.25%, respectively. And the degradation mechanism of organic materials in urine was also investigated. This work provided an effective self-powered system which could totally remove the hazardous bacteria and degrade the organics in the urine.																			2211-2855	2211-3282				JUN 1	2022	96								107111	10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107111		MAR 2022											WOS:000781975000006

Accordingly, it is used in a great number of biocatalytic reactions, as analytical biosensors, and in test kits for diagnostic and analytical purposes. This coenzyme is unstable in aqueous solutions, meaning that the minimization of its degradation during storage, assays, and enzyme-catalysed oxidoreductive reactions is of high importance. Herein, we report on the stabilisation of NAD (NAD(+) as oxidised, and NADH as its reduced form) by deep eutectic solvents (DES), an emerging class of solvents that offer numerous remarkable advantages such as high tunability, and capability to stabilise a wide range of commercially important compounds of natural origin. Preliminary DES screening revealed that out of 7 candidates, choline chloride:urea (ChCl:U) shows the best ability to stabilise both NAD forms. Computational analysis (quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations) provided a deeper insight into possible mechanisms behind the observed stabilisation, by identifying geometries and the solvation structure of NAD coenzymes in these solvents, and analysing their possible degradation pathways. Finally, prolonged NAD stability (up to 50 days) in ChCl:U is detected and the system is further confirmed as a stable working NAD solution in a model enzymatic assay.

AuND structures can be synthesized using electrodeposition method utilizing cysteine as growth directing agent. This method can simultaneously synthesize and integrate the gold nanostructures on the surface of the electrode. We conducted a comprehensive study on the synthesis of AuND on screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE)-based working electrode, focusing on the optimization of electrodeposition parameters, such as applied potential, precursor solution concentration, and deposition time. The measured surface oxide reduction peak current and electrochemical surface area from cyclic voltammogram were used as the optimization indicators. We confirmed the growth of dendritic gold nanostructures across the carbon electrode surface based on FESEM, EDS, and XRD characterizations. We applied the SPCE/AuND electrode as a nonenzymatic sensor on ascorbic acid (AA) and obtained detection limit of 16.8 mu M, quantification limit of 51.0 mu M, sensitivity of 0.0629 mu A mu M-1, and linear range of 180-2700 mu M (R2 value = 0.9909). Selectivity test of this electrode against several interferences, such as uric acid, dopamine, glucose, and urea, also shows good response in AA detection.

The development of wood adhesives that exhibit robustadhesion,exceptional water resistance, sustainability, affordability, nontoxicity,and simplicity is highly recommended for practical applications. Inthis study, the structure of microcrystalline cellulose was successfullymodified with dialdehyde groups based on previous reports. Aromaticpolyamines and urea were polymerized into phenyl-polyurea (Ph-U) through fusion and condensation, without the use of catalysts orsolvents. The DAC-Ph-U adhesives were synthesized throughthe reaction between dialdehyde cellulose (DAC) and Ph-U under ambient conditions. Reinforcing and cross-linkingeffects of Ph-U on its properties were systematicallyinvestigated. The mechanical, adhesive, and water repellent propertieswere enhanced through the introduction of aldehyde (from DAC) and amino group (from Ph-U) interactions into thecross-linking structure with Schiff base cross-linking. The interactionof covalent (C=N) and multiple non-covalent bonds in the cross-linkedsystem functions as a hydrophobic barrier, impeding water infiltrationinto the bonding interface. The bonding strength test revealed thatthe optimal strength of DAC-Ph-U adhesives reached 2.91MPa (dry strength), 1.96 MPa (after 63 & DEG;C water immersion), and1.75 MPa (after burning water immersion), respectively. Its comprehensiveproperties were not only superior to traditional formaldehyde-basedresin adhesives but also far higher than the requirements of industrialwood-based panels. This study provides ideas for replacing fossilaldehydes such as formaldehyde, glyoxal, glutaraldehyde, etc. in woodadhesive fields and can be potentially generalized to reinforce theperformance of biocomposites, coatings, plastics, hydrogels, etc.					Tan, Xiaoping/V-5896-2019; Gao, Wei/E-7132-2013	Tan, Xiao-ping/0000-0001-6531-0251; liu, tong da/0000-0002-5563-6925; Gao, Wei/0000-0002-3670-4224													2168-0485					AUG 3	2023	11	32					11878	11889		10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c01673	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c01673		AUG 2023											WOS:001042176100001

However, its role as a metabolic modifier is not well understood. We aimed to determine biosignatures of response to bariatric surgery and elucidate short-term metabolic adaptations. Methods We used a LC- and FIA-ESI-MS/MS approach to quantify acylcarnitines, (lyso)phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, amino acids, biogenic amines and hexoses in serum samples of subjects with morbid obesity (n = 39) before and 1, 3 and 6 months after bariatric surgery. K-means cluster analysis allowed to distinguish metabotypes of response to bariatric surgery. Results For the first time, global metabolic changes following bariatric surgery independent of the baseline health status of the subjects have been revealed. We identify two metabolic phenotypes (metabotypes) at the interval 6 months-baseline after surgery, which presented differences in the levels of compounds of urea metabolism, gluconeogenic precursors and (lyso) phospholipid particles. Clinically, metabotypes were different in terms of the degree of improvement in insulin resistance, cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins and uric acid independent of the magnitude of weight loss. Conclusions This study opens new perspectives and new hypotheses on the metabolic benefits of bariatric surgery and understanding of the biology of obesity and its associated diseases.

Given the challenges in traditional water electrolysis, coupling the kinetically favora-ble anodic electrooxidation reactions of easily oxidizable substances with the hydrogen evolution reaction in a hybrid water electrolysis (HWE) configuration not only solves the pollutant emission and biomass recycling problems but also maximizes the return on energy profiteering. Various advanced compounds have been engineered through compositional regulation, structural optimiza-tion, surface nano-building, and electronic structure modification, yet some issues like tedious preparation and unsatisfactory durability still exist. Considering the gap between research and practical deployment, this review amply addresses the state-of-the-art achievements of synergistic electrocatalysis systems for the co-production of high-purity H2 and valuable products with a low energy consumption and high Faradaic efficiency. An overview of HWE system is presented first accompanied by a discussion on the design and engineering of high reactive/selective/stable elec-trodes/electrocatalysts for anodic oxidation of organic/biomass substrates. Importantly, the in-depth understanding of possible reaction mechanisms from both experimental and theoretical perspectives is elucidated to promote the efficiency of synergistic electrocatalysis. Subsequently, the recent research breakthroughs in the field of HWE technology are emphatically reviewed, providing a new room for low-voltage H2 generation from waste products and renewable feedstock. Some mechanism explorations, feasibility analyses, and correlation comparisons are highlighted. Finally, we propose the prospects on existing challenges with some opportunities for future research direc-tions to push forward the progress in synergistic electrocatalysis configurations.

The CO2 gas, NH3 and water vapor produced during the thermal process reshaped the morphology and textural properties of the of O-MCN compared to pristine mesoporous carbon nitride (MCN). Highest bisphenol A (BPA) removal achieved under visible light irradiation was 97%, with 60% mineralization ([BPA] = 10 mg L-1: catalyst dosage = 40 mg L-1; pH = 10; 180 min). In addition to mesoporosity, the sub-gap impurity states created from the oxygen doping reduced recombination rate of photogenerated carriers. Holes (h(+)) and superoxide (O-2(-)) were identified as the predominant active species responsible for the photodegradation process. The photodegradation route was proposed based on the intermediates detected by LC-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (LC/TOF-MS). The Density of States (DOS) showed that oxygen doping resulted in a higher photoactivity due to the stronger localization and delocalization of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The adsorption pathway of the BPA on the O-MCN and MCN was successfully predicted using the DFT calculations, namely molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), global and local descriptors.

However, reports of adverse reactions, intoxications and fatalities have been increasing. Information regarding the molecular, biochemical, and histological alterations underlying their toxicological potential is missing, particularly for tapentadol, owing to its more recent market authorization. Considering the paramount importance of liver and kidney for the metabolism and excretion of both opioids, these organs are especially susceptible to toxicological damage. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the putative hepatic and renal deleterious effects of repeated exposure to therapeutic doses of tramadol and tapentadol, using an in vivo animal model. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six experimental groups, composed of six animals each, which received daily single intraperitoneal injections of 10, 25 or 50 mg/kg tramadol or tapentadol (a low, standard analgesic dose, an intermediate dose and the maximum recommended daily dose, respectively). An additional control group was injected with normal saline. Following 14 consecutive days of administration, serum, urine and liver and kidney tissue samples were processed for biochemical, metabolic and histological analysis. Repeated administration of therapeutic doses of both opioids led to: (i) increased lipid and protein oxidation in liver and kidney, as well as to decreased total liver antioxidant capacity; (ii) decreased serum albumin, urea, butyrylcholinesterase and complement C3 and C4 levels, denoting liver synthesis impairment; (iii) elevated serum activity of liver enzymes, such as alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and -gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, as well as lipid profile alterations, also reflecting hepatobiliary commitment; (iv) derangement of iron metabolism, as shown through increases in serum iron, ferritin, haptoglobin and heme oxygenase-1 levels. In turn, elevated serum cystatin C, decreased urine creatinine output and increased urine microalbumin levels were detected upon exposure to tapentadol only, while increased serum amylase and urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activities were observed for both opioids. Collectively, these results are compatible with kidney injury. Changes were also found in the expression levels of liver- and kidney-specific toxicity biomarker genes, upon exposure to tramadol and tapentadol, correlating well with alterations in lipid profile, iron metabolism and glomerular and tubular function. Histopathological analysis evidenced sinusoidal dilatation, microsteatosis, mononuclear cell infiltrates, glomerular and tubular disorganization, and increased Bowman's spaces. Although some findings are more pronounced upon tapentadol exposure, our study shows that, when compared with acute exposure, prolonged administration of both opioids smooths the differences between their toxicological effects, and that these occur at lower doses within the therapeutic range.

In this work, small amounts of gold were recovered by digestion with aqua regia from waste tailings. The recovered gold in the form of HAuCl(4)was then used to deposit Au(0)onto radially aligned nanorutile (RANR) to form a supported catalyst material. The support material, RANR, was synthesized using the hydrothermal technique whereas the deposition of gold was achieved using the deposition-precipitation with urea method at various loadings. Electron microscopy was used to show that the structure of the support is a sphere formed by multiple nanorods aligned in a radial structure. The Au nanoparticles were observed at the tips of the nanorods. It was confirmed by XRD that the support was indeed a rutile phase of TiO(2)and that the Au nanoparticles had a face-centred cubic structure. The various catalysts were then used to synthesize carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) using the chemical vapour deposition technique. A parametric study varying the reaction temperature, duration and carbon source gas flow rate was conducted to study the effects these conditions have on the structural properties of the resulting CNMs. Here, it was found that mainly carbon nanofibers were formed and that the different reaction conditions influenced their graphicity, width, structure and thermal properties.

Waterborne polyurethane and graphene/graphene oxide-based nanocomposites: Reinforcement and electrical conductivity	EXPRESS POLYMER LETTERS												Polyurethane based materials show great potential for many applications, and their reinforcement with different kinds of nano-entities can improve their properties or supply them with new ones, widening their fields of applications to new opportunities. In this work, nanocomposites composed of a biobased waterborne polyurethane and carbonaceous reinforcements were prepared and characterized. Parting from graphite, graphene, and graphene oxide were obtained through a mechanical and a chemical route, respectively, and graphene oxide was reduced into graphene through a thermal process. Successful exfoliation, oxidation, and reduction processes were proven when characterizing graphene, graphene oxide, and reduced graphene oxide. Nancomposites reinforced with graphene and graphene oxide showed improved mechanical and thermomcchanical properties, whereas they did not show electrical conductivity. Coatings of the systems with graphene and reduced graphene oxide were studied, to grant electrical properties to the composites. Electrical conductor materials were obtained after coating the systems, as shown by Electrostatic Force Microscopy and electrical conductivity measurements.

Herein, an effective Pt catalyst/support design strategy by using urea to modify the carbon supports is reported, in which the balance between nitrogen doping and Pt nanoparticle deposition can be well achieved without sacrificing catalyst performance. The nitrogen-modified carbon with the positively charged surface can electrostatically attract with ionomer with negative charges in a catalyst ink. Meanwhile, ionomer can be preserved into a solid catalyst layer, forming a desirable ionomer/catalyst interface with improved dry proton accessibility and lowered oxygen transport resistance. Consequently, this interface leads to striking performance improvement in the kinetic and mass transport regions in the membrane electrode assembly level, with the current density of 1.11 A cm-2 at 0.65 V under 50% RH and 85 degrees C operating conditions, reaching 2.8 times this value compared with the one without modification. The nitrogen-doped carbon with a positively charged surface can attract negatively charged Nafion ionomer via Coulombic interaction, allowing the realization of building an active triple-phase boundary at the Pt catalyst layer. With this ideal catalyst layer, better management of oxygen, electrons, and protons occurring on the triple-phase boundary gives rise to enhanced catalytic performance for proton exchange membrane fuel cells.image					Yao, Yingfang/HSI-0502-2023; yang, juan/MIP-9642-2025; wu, zirui/HDN-2071-2022; Zou, Zhigang/AFG-8475-2022	Zou, Zhigang/0000-0003-2092-8335													1616-301X	1616-3028				MAY	2024	34	19								10.1002/adfm.202310428	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202310428		JAN 2024											WOS:001142414200001

Thirty-two 14-day-old broiler chickens were divided into four treatment groups that were fed diets with or without 0.7% orotic acid under thermoneutral (25 +/- 1 degrees C) or cyclic HT (35 +/- 1 degrees C for 8 h/day) conditions for 2 weeks. The chickens exposed to HT had higher plasma malondialdehyde concentrations, suggesting an increase in lipid peroxidation, which is alleviated by orotic acid supplementation. The HT environment also affected the serine, glutamine, and tyrosine plasma concentrations, while orotic acid supplementation affected the aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and tyrosine plasma concentrations. Untargeted gas chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS)-based metabolomics analysis identified that the HT affected the plasma levels of metabolites involved in purine metabolism, ammonia recycling, pyrimidine metabolism, homocysteine degradation, glutamate metabolism, urea cycle, beta-alanine metabolism, glycine and serine metabolism, and aspartate metabolism, while orotic acid supplementation affected metabolites involved in pyrimidine metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism, the malate-aspartate shuttle, and aspartate metabolism. Our results suggest that cyclic HT affects various metabolic processes in broiler chickens, and that orotic acid supplementation ameliorates HT-induced increases in lipid peroxidation.

J	Liu, YH; Teng, Y; Jing, FK; Zhang, YN				Liu, Yuhan; Teng, Yan; Jing, Fangkun; Zhang, Yanning			Effect and Mechanism of CircPTPN4 Expression in Carboxylated Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes on Renal Fibrosis	SCIENCE OF ADVANCED MATERIALS												This research was aimed to investigate the effect of circPTPN4 overexpression in carboxylated single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT-COOH) on renal fibrosis (RF) in mice. SWCNT was oxidized to SWCNT-COOH by concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid ( 3:1, v/v). After characterization and analysis, the effect of SWCNTCOOH on erythrocyte status was detected. The RF mice (RFM) model was induced by SWCNT-COOH, normal mice as normal control (NC), and 1x10(8) TU/mL lenti-NC was injected into the tail vein as negative control, and 1x10(8) TU/mL lenti- circPTPN4 was injected for circPTPN4 overexpression. The expression of circPTPN4 was tested by qRT-PCR. Serum creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen ( BUN), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were tested by ELISA. HE, Masson, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the pathological changes of kidney tissue. The protein expressions of collagen I (COL1), fibronectin (Fn), alpha-SMA, TGF-beta 1, Smad3, p-Smad3, and Smad7 were tested by Western blot (WB). It presented SWCNT- COOH was successfully prepared by chemical oxidation method, with an average particle size of 98.1 nm and an average Zeta potential of -38.91 mV. SWCNT-COOH had good hydrophilicity, and did not cause aggregation and morphology changes of red blood cells. As against NC, the expression of circPTPN4 in RFM and lenti-NC groups was decreased; the kidney coefficient was increased, and the normal structure of the kidney was abnormal, accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen microformation; serum Cr, BUN, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TGF-beta 1 were increased, and KIM-1 and NGAL in renal cortex were decreased; the protein expressions of COL1, Fn, alpha-SMA, TGF-beta 1, and p-Smad3 in the kidney were increased, and the protein expression of Smad7 was decreased (P < 0.05). As against RFM, the expression of circPTPN4 in lenti-circPTPN4 group was increased; the kidney coefficient decreased and the kidney structure returned to normal; COL1, Fn, alpha-SMA, TGF-beta 1, and p-Smad3 in the kidney were decreased, and that of Smad7 was increased ( P < 0.05). SWCNT-COOH has good blood compatibility characteristics and can induce RF in mice. The expression of circPTPN4 was down- regulated in the RFM. Overexpression of circPTPN4 can restore the normal renal function of RFM, inhibiting the inflammatory response and RF process.																			1947-2935	1947-2943				JUL	2023	15	7					962	971		10.1166/sam.2023.4504	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/sam.2023.4504													WOS:001073492300004

OrphanAnesthesia - Recommendation for the anaesthesiological management of patients with Mitochondrial cytopathy and Hurler syndrome	ANASTHESIOLOGIE & INTENSIVMEDIZIN												Although the mitochondria host several metabolic pathways including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, urea cycle, beta-fatty acid oxidation, their primary function involves the generation of adenosine triphosphate via aerobic respiration. Mitochondrial disorders are genetically and phenotypically a heterogeneous group with an estimated incidence of one in 4,000. Genetically, one of the 13 protein subunits of the respiratory chain complexes I, III, IV and V, one of the 22 tRNAs or the two rRNAs (mitochondrialencoded mitochondriopathy) or one of the approximately 1,000 nuclear-encoded proteins, which are important to mitochondrial structure and function, are impaired. Mitochondrial-encoded mitochondriopathies are inherited maternally, while nuclear-encoded types are inherited with classical Mendelian genetics (Xlinked recessive, autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant). The most severe, inherited mitochondrial disorders, many of them lethal, become clinically apparent during infancy. Later appearance in early adulthood has been described. In mitochondrial DNA-encoded disorders, normal and mutant mitochondrial DNA coexist. "Heteroplasmy" refers to the random differences in the ratio of mutant to normal mitochondrial DNA present in the target tissue during embryogenesis, which partially explains the marked variability in clinical manifestations. Usually mitochondriopathies are multi-systemic diseases, although single-organ manifestations or specific symptoms may prevail. Organs with a high-energy turnover like the central nervous system, muscle, heart, liver and kidney are typically affected. Impaired renal bioenergetics produce tubular acidosis, and skeletal muscle abnormalities, which present largely as dystonia. Dysphagia, pseudo-obstruction and constipation suggest gastrointestinal involvement. Vision and hearing may be reduced. Endocrine organ involvement resulting in diabetes mellitus, hypoparathyroidism, hypothyroidism and gonadal failure has also been described. Seizures and ataxia are associated with myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibres (MERRF), and encephalopathy is a symptom of Leigh syndrome. Necrotising lesions within the brain, particularly in the midbrain and the brainstem, are typical pathological signs of Leigh syndrome. This syndrome, which typically begins within the first year of life, is clinically characterised by dysphagia, epileptic seizures, muscle hypotonia, dystonia, ataxia, ophthal-moparesis, cardiomyopathy and finally respiratory failure. Dementia and stroke like symptoms are major features of the mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Furthermore, the peripheral nervous system is affected, causing axonal sensory neuropathy. Cardiac involvement includes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (seen in MELAS and Leigh syndrome) or heart block, dilated cardiomyopathy and pre-excitation syndrome. Initial symptoms of adult-onset forms are typically progressive postural muscle weakness/exercise intolerance, sensoryneural hearing loss, ptosis, ophthalmo-paresis, failing colour or night vision, and worsening ataxia. Hepatic insufficiency and renal involvement are common components of Toni-Debre-Fanconi syndrome (primarily in children).																			0170-5334	1439-0256				JUL-AUG	2021	62						324	329																WOS:000685166700008
J	Xiang, CY; Yan, Y; Zhang, DG				Xiang, Chengyu; Yan, Yi; Zhang, Dingguo			Alleviation of the doxorubicin-induced nephrotoxicity by fasudil in vivo and in vitro	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Objective: Treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin (DOX), is limited by side effects. We have previously demonstrated that fasudil, a Rho/ROCK inhibitor, has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects in contrast-induced acute kidney injury model. The present study to investigated the possible protective effect of fasudil, on DOX-induced nephrotoxicity. Materials and method: In vivo: Forty male C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: Control group, DOX treatment group (DOX group), DOX + low dose fasudil (DOX + L group), DOX + high dose fasudil (DOX + H group). Mice in 2-4 groups received DOX (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) once a week for 8 weeks. The 3 and 4 group were given 2 mg/kg/d or 10 mg/kg/d fasudil before DOX injection. respectively. Meanwhile, the control group received saline. At the end of week eight, blood samples were collected for biochemical testing. The kidneys were removed for histological, immunohistochemical, Western blot, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and molecular detection. In vitro: NRK-52E cells were treated with 40 uM fasudil for 12 h, then incubated with 1 uM DOX for 24 h. Cells then collected for qRT-PCR and Western blot. Results: In vivo, fasudil treatment ameliorated DOX-induced immunofluorescence reaction of DNA damage-related factors (8-OHdG), decreased the expression of Bax, Caspase-3, p16, p21 and p53, and increased the expression of protein of Bcl-2, Bmi-1 and Sirt-1. In the mouse model, administration of fasudil significantly ameliorated DOX-induced kidney damage, suppressed cell apoptosis and senescence, ameliorated redox imbalance and DNA damage. At the same time, DOX produced obvious kidney damage revealed by kidney functions changes: increased serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations. In addition, kidney tissue staining in the DOX group showed abnormal structure and fibroproliferative disorders. And DOX could promote the oxidation and senescence of kidney cells, leading to increased expression of 8-OHdG and senescence and apoptosis-related factors. On the contrary, fasudil treatment can effectively inhibit redox imbalance and DNA damage caused by DOX, and inhibit cell senescence and apoptosis. Fasudil can inhibit excessive activation of Rho/ROCK signaling pathway, thereby improving kidney tissue fibrosis and recovery kidney function. Conclusion: Fasudil has a protective effect on DOX-induced nephrotoxicity in mice and NRK-52E cells, which can inhibit oxidative stress and DNA damage, inhibit apoptosis, and delays cell senescence by inhibiting RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway.

J	Khalek, IA; Blanks, MG; Merritt, PM; Zielinska, B				Khalek, Imad A.; Blanks, Matthew G.; Merritt, Patrick M.; Zielinska, Barbara			Regulated and unregulated emissions from modern 2010 emissions-compliant heavy-duty on-highway diesel engines	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION												The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established strict regulations for highway diesel engine exhaust emissions of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) to aid in meeting the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The emission standards were phased in with stringent standards for 2007 model year (MY) heavy-duty engines (HDEs), and even more stringent NOX standards for 2010 and later model years. The Health Effects Institute, in cooperation with the Coordinating Research Council, funded by government and the private sector, designed and conducted a research program, the Advanced Collaborative Emission Study (ACES), with multiple objectives, including detailed characterization of the emissions from both 2007- and 2010-compliant engines. The results from emission testing of 2007-compliant engines have already been reported in a previous publication. This paper reports the emissions testing results for three heavy-duty 2010-compliant engines intended for on-highway use. These engines were equipped with an exhaust diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), high-efficiency catalyzed diesel particle filter (DPF), urea-based selective catalytic reduction catalyst (SCR), and ammonia slip catalyst (AMOX), and were fueled with ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel (similar to 6.5 ppm sulfur). Average regulated and unregulated emissions of more than 780 chemical species were characterized in engine exhaust under transient engine operation using the Federal Test Procedure cycle and a 16-hr duty cycle representing a wide dynamic range of real-world engine operation. The 2010 engines' regulated emissions of PM, NOX, nonmethane hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide were all well below the EPA 2010 emission standards. Moreover, the unregulated emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitroPAHs, hopanes and steranes, alcohols and organic acids, alkanes, carbonyls, dioxins and furans, inorganic ions, metals and elements, elemental carbon, and particle number were substantially (90 to >99%) lower than pre-2007-technology engine emissions, and also substantially (46 to >99%) lower than the 2007-technology engine emissions characterized in the previous study.Implications:Heavy-duty on-highway diesel engines equipped with DOC/DPF/SCR/AMOX and fueled with ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel produced lower emissions than the stringent 2010 emission standards established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They also resulted in significant reductions in a wide range of unregulated toxic emission compounds relative to older technology engines. The increased use of newer technology (2010+) diesel engines in the on-highway sector and the adaptation of such technology by other sectors such as nonroad, displacing older, higher emissions engines, will have a positive impact on ambient levels of PM, NOx, and volatile organic compounds, in addition to many other toxic compounds.																			1096-2247	2162-2906				AUG	2015	65	8					987	1001		10.1080/10962247.2015.1051606	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10962247.2015.1051606								26037832					WOS:000358664500011

Different analytical methods have been reported for the detection of phenylureas; however, several of them are expensive, time-consuming, and require complex pretreatment steps. Here, we show a simple method for the simultaneous electrochemical determination of two phenylurea herbicides by differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetry (DPAdSV) using a modified platinum/chitosan electrode. The one-step synthesized platinum/chitosan PtNPs/CS was successfully characterized by TEM, XRPD, and FT-IR, and applied through the sensing platform designated as PtNPs/CS/GCE. This bio-based modified electrode is proposed for the first time for the individual and/or simultaneous electrochemical detection of the phenylurea herbicides diuron and isoproturon compounds extensively used worldwide that present a very similar chemical structure. Electrochemical and interfacial characteristics of the modified electrode were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). It was found that the oxidation mechanism of diuron and isoproturon occurs in two different pathways, with a peak-to-peak definition of ca. 0.15 V. Under differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetry (DPAdSV) optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) was estimated as 7 mu g L-1 for isoproturon and 20 mu g L-1 for diumn (E-d = +0.8 V; t(d) = 100 s). The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of both analytes in river water samples, at three different levels, with a recovery range of 90-110%. The employment of the bio-based sensing platform PtNPs/CS/GCE allows a novel and easy analytical method to the multi-component phenylurea herbicides detection.

This work investigated the effect of recombination of rare earth (RE = Y, La, Ce, Pr and Nd) and Nb element, different calcination temperature and preparation methods on the physical/chemical properties of RENbO4+delta mixed oxides. These materials were used for catalytic combustion of chlorinated VOCs (using monochlorobenzene and 1,2-dichloroethane as representative examples), and the structure-performance relationship was explored. The results showed that the optimal catalyst was the oxygen-rich Ce-Nb-O mixed oxide. It was gradually sintered above 700 degrees C to form CeNbO4+delta compound, and its apparent catalytic activity decreased with the increase of calcination temperature. The high dispersion of Nb2O5 into CeO2 matrix lead to strong interaction between Ce, Nb and O elements, and thus more active oxygen species were obtained, which was beneficial to improving redox property and catalytic performance of catalyst. The apparent catalytic activity decreased in the order of CeNbO-hp (homogeneous precipitation of urea)>CeNbO-cp (co-precipitation of (NH4)(2)CO3)>CeNbO-sg (citric acid based sol-gel method) >CeNbO-mm (simple mechanical mixing of Nb2O5 and CeO2)>pure Nb2O5, CeO2. In the continuous reaction of 100 h, both monochlorobenzene and 1,2-dichloroethane could be completely destroyed at 320 degrees C to form HCl, CO2 and H2O on the optimized CeNbO-hp.					yang, peng/IQV-3841-2023; Luo, Hong/A-7681-2018; Pan, Pengju/GNM-5506-2022	Yang, Peng/0000-0002-3645-6443													0022-4596	1095-726X				SEP	2022	313								123318	10.1016/j.jssc.2022.123318	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jssc.2022.123318													WOS:000876060400002

Here, we develop a solid-state reagent-free chemiresistive H2O2 sensor, which can measure H2O2 over a wide measuring range of 0.5-1000 ppm (0.015-29.4 mM). The sensor was fabricated using a network of functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as a sensitive layer and a xurographically patterned gold leaf as a contact electrode. The SWCNTs were functionalized with crystal violet to impart selective detection of H2O2. The crystal violet was self-assembled on the SWCNT film and subsequently polymerized via cyclic voltammetry to improve its retention on the sensing layer. The functionalized sensor exhibited good selectivity against common interferents such as uric acid, urea, glucose, and galactose. In addition, the sensor was used to measure in situ H2O2 generated during peroxidase assays performed using enzymes like glucose oxidase. The sensor was tested in standard buffer solutions for both enzymes. The glucose oxidase assay was also demonstrated in spiked pooled human plasma samples. The glucose oxidase-coated sensor exhibited a glucose detection range of 2-20 mM in standard buffer and blood plasma solutions, with a good recovery rate (similar to 95-107%) for glucose measurements in blood plasma.

In this study, the HMFS intermediate (HMFS-IM) was enzymatically prepared from palm oil without using other oil sources. First, the amount of 16:0 at the sn-2 position of TAG substrate was enhanced from 18.9% to more 34.5% via a random esterification reaction using a non-stereospecific lipase, Novozym (R) 435, to produce a random-palm substrate. Consequently, 2-monoacylglycerol (2-MAG) rich in 16:0 at the sn-2 position over 88%, together with the FA ethyl ester substrates rich in LUFAs, such as 18:1-Et and 18:2-Et above 93.5% was prepared through ethanolysis reaction using the same lipase from the random-palm substrate and by purification with urea complexation, respectively. As the preferred modified method, a continuous use of the same lipase to these reactions were achieved while reducing the usage of enzyme to half. Finally, an HMFS-IM rich in 16:0 at the sn-2 position more than 60% and LUFA at sn-1(3) positions was prepared using these palm oil based products, including random-palm, palm-Et, and 2-MAG, via the interesterification reaction using a 1,3-stereospecific lipase, Lipozyme (R) RM-IM. Thus, HMFS-IM was successfully prepared by palm oil materials with a 65 wt% usage ratio. The concept described in this study will be useful for HMFS manufacturing from a single natural oil substrate, which is not initially rich in 16:0 at the sn-2 position.					重三郎, 小河/ABC-6736-2020														1345-8957	1347-3352					2021	70	2					165	173		10.5650/jos.ess20101	http://dx.doi.org/10.5650/jos.ess20101								33455999					WOS:000614562300003

Diffraction of X-ray (XRD), canning electronic microscopy (SEM) with an energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to investigate the effects of the impregnating of LLa0.8Mn0.2FeO3 on SiC membrane pore-structure (La0.8Mn0.2FeO3-CM). The catalytic self-cleaning performance of the as-prepared membranes was assessed through peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation under a cross-flow filtration mode. Results indicate that La0.8Mn0.2FeO3 has been successfully impregnated into the macropores of SiC membranes without pore blocking, and 92.4 % of the flux recovery rate (FRR) was achieved when the PMS concentration was 70 mM and catalytic flushing time was 45 min. Therefore, the La0.8Mn0.2FeO3 impregnated SiC membrane exhibited excellent catalytic self-cleaning property, which can effectively avoid the environmental pollution and the deterioration of membrane materials caused by chemical cleaning for membrane fouling. In addition, the radical quenching experiment and electron spin resonance (EPR) tests were conducted in the catalytic self-cleaning process, and the results suggested that the hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) and sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) are simultaneously captured and center dot OH is the dominant active species. This study embarks on a novel and environmental friendly membrane cleaning approach for irreversible fouling eliminates in diverse membrane separation applications.																			0272-8842	1873-3956				AUG 15	2024	50	16					28054	28063		10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.05.103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.05.103		JUN 2024											WOS:001254390700001

The organic or inorganic nitrogen mayact as a carcinogen depending on the reduction of nitrate to nitrite and the subsequent reactions of nitrite with other molecules, leading to the formation of N-nitroso compounds. Objectives: This study aimed to determine the effects of nitrate and Vitamin C on oxidative stress in the renal tissue of rats. Methods: This experimental study was conducted in Iran during the 2017-2018. The sample size was estimated to include 55 Wistar male rats using Morgan's table and Cochran's formula. In total, 49 rats were selected and divided into seven groups of: (1) NO3 = 0 mg/L (control), (2) NO3 =10 mg/L, (3) NO3 = 45 mg/L, (4) NO3 = 200 mg/L, (5) NO3 = 10 mg/L+ Vitamin C 20 mg/100 g BW (Body Weight), (6) NO3 = 45 mg/L + Vitamin C 20 mg/100 g BW, and (7) NO3 = 200 mg/L + Vitamin C 20 mg/100 g BW. Blood samples were obtained to determine blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. An autopsy was performed on the renal tissue to evaluate oxidative stress indicators including malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH). Results: In this research, the fourth group showed a significant increase in the level of creatinine (50.14 +/- 2.6, 43.14 +/- 1.21, P = 0.01) and BUN (0.72 +/- 0.04, 0.57 +/- 0.11, P = 0.003) compared to the control group. On the other hand, a significant increase was observed in the level of MDA in the fourth group compared to the control group (P= 0.01), whereas a significant reduction was found in the levels of CAT (P = 0.001), SOD (P = 0.02), and GSH (P= 0.02). In addition, the levels of creatinine and BUN significantly reduced in the seventh group compared to the fourth group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the use of Vitamin C resulted in a significant reduction in MDA and an increase in SOD, CAT, and GSH in the seventh group compared to the fourth group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: According to the results of the study, nitrate in drinking water and the prescription of Vitamin C had no significant effect in the presence of nitrate doses of 10 and 45 mg/L. However, a 200 mg/L dose of nitrate significantly affected BUN, serum creatinine, and oxidative stress indicators, causing the kidney disease.

Designing of highly active g-C3N4/Sn doped ZnO heterostructure as a photocatalyst for the disinfection and degradation of the organic pollutants under visible light irradiation	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY												The use of nanocomposites having heterostructured junctions-nanoparticle combination for enhanced photocatalytic degradation ability is in practice. These nanocomposites were considered better photocatalysts due to increased electron-hole pair production and delay in their recombination rate. Thus, photogenerated electronhole pairs were also reported to be used as good antibacterial agents. In this study, a series of g-C3N4 hybridized with Sn doped ZnO novel nanocomposites were prepared using the unique chemical co-precipitation method. This synthesis method was known as a low-cost, environmentally-friendly, in-situ fabrication process. Zinc acetate, Tin chloride, and urea are being used as precursor materials. The morphology of synthesized g-C3N4 hybridized with Sn doped ZnO nanocomposite was mainly assessed by XRD, FTIR, TEM, and SEM techniques. The elemental determination was performed by using EDS analysis, and band gaps were calculated using the tauc plot method. The photocatalytic ability of synthesized materials was established by photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) dye under sunlight irradiation. To establish reactive oxygen species involved in the photocatalytic mechanism, a series of scavenger experiments were conducted. It was discovered that both O-center dot(2)- and h(+) radicals are involved in photodegradation and antibacterial activity. The visible light cropping was assessed by using PL spectroscopy. The surface area calculations were made via BET analysis. The antibacterial properties were assessed against Escherichia Cob, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus saliyerius.

J	Huang, XS; Li, LP; Li, GS				Huang Xin-Song, H.; Li Li-Ping; Li Guang-She			Internalization of Foreign Ions into Meta-stable Lattices: a Case Study of Transition-metal-doped Brookite	CHINESE JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL CHEMISTRY												The connections between the building units of meta-stable lattice were generally considered to be easily disturbed during the doping process, causing serious hindrances blocking the development of functional doped materials. In this work, the synthesis of doped brookite, a typical meta-stable phase of TiO2, has been explored novelly by in-situ adding of cations of VIIIB and IB; IIB elements in the 3rd period (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) during the urea-lactate aided low-basicity hydrothermal process. The results showed that only Cu-doped brookite could be successfully synthesized with trace amount of copper intensively internalized into the brookite lattice, while the other dopants lead to the formation of anatase TiO2. Extensive characterizations indicated a two-step doping process, where copper ions were firstly dispersed in an amorphous layer on the lattice surface and then they were internalized into brookite lattice. Cu-doped brookite exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity in the phenol degradation under visible light compared to bare brookite. The enhancement of catalytic performance was assigned to the impurity band gap and the reduction of charge carriers' recombination introduced by the internalization of Cu ions. The investigation reported herein contributes to the understanding of complex ion-doping effects on the structures of meta-stable materials, and provides hints for obtaining other functional doped materials.																			0254-5861					AUG	2016	35	8					1157	1166		10.14102/j.cnki.0254-5861.2011-1340	http://dx.doi.org/10.14102/j.cnki.0254-5861.2011-1340													WOS:000382598600001
J	Zenou, VY; Bakardjieva, S				Zenou, Victor Y.; Bakardjieva, Snejana			Microstructural analysis of undoped and moderately Sc-doped TiO2 anatase nanoparticles using Scherrer equation and Debye function analysis	MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION												UV light sensitive undoped and moderate (4 at.%) Sc-doped anatase nanocrystallites were prepared by an efficient and environmentally benign method based on homogeneous hydrolysis of TiOSO4 and Sc-2(C2O4)(3.5)H2O aqueous solutions using urea as a precipitation agent, without post-synthesis calcination or annealing. X-ray diffraction study of the obtained powders revealed single phase anatase in both samples. Two different methods were applied to estimate the anatase crystallite size and shape from the X-ray diffraction data. The first one is based on the more conventional Scherrer equation (as implanted in GSAS-II program) while the second one is based on Debye function analysis (as implanted in DUBUSSY suite version 2.2), which is considered to be more adequate for nanocrystallites. Although each program has its own shape models, both methods indicated similar results of elongated nanocrystallite geometry for Sc-doped TiO2: (i) GSAS-II confirmed ellipsoid shape with equatorial size of 5.1(0) nm and axial size of 6.8(0), (ii) DEBUSSY suite 2.2 showed cylinder shape with diameter of equivalent circle in the ab-plane, D-ab = 4.9(1.0) nm and crystallite length along the c-axis, L-c = 5.4(3.2) nm. For the undoped TiO2 sample, equatorial size of 5.5(0) nm and axial size of 7.3(0) nm for the ellipsoid shape was determined according to GSAS-II, while D-ab = 5.5(1.3) nm and L-c = 6.0(2.2) nm for the cylinder shape was determined by DEBUSSY suite 2.2. These outcomes were found to corroborate with HRTEM analysis. Doping with 4 at.% Sc caused similar to 0.3% growth of lattice parameters from a = 3.7979 [4] angstrom, c = 9.4995 [9] angstrom for the undoped sample to a = 3.8110 [7] angstrom, c = 9.5274 [16] angstrom for the moderately Sc doped sample, while reduction in the Ti vacancies by half was confirmed by both methods. The introducing of Sc as electronically active secondary species into the crystal lattice of TiO2 can greatly alter its optical absorption. The incorporation of Sc into the crystal lattice of TiO2 favors the substitution of Ti, as both have approximately the same ionic size, and generates surface oxygen vacancies which can act as trapping center for the photogenerated electrons and reduce the recombination of electron hole pairs. We can expect Sc doped TiO2 nanomaterials to have applications as effective photocatalysts for selective photocatalytic oxidation of various environmental organic pollutants.

The Ni1-xMnxO (0.15 <= X <= 0.50) nanoparticle synthesized was found to be cubic and the existence of Mn3O4 and MnO2 phases were established and confirmed by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) studies. Thermo Gravimetric-Differential Thermal Analysis (TG-DTA) studies provided the calcination temperature of the xerogel at 600 degrees C, wherein the lattice strain and the size of the nanoparticles were determined through Williamson Hall (WH) Plot. The surface morphology characteristics of these nanoclusters were authenticated by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) techniques. Further, electroanalytical techniques were employed as a tool in establishing the nanocomposite as an intriguing material to act as a capacitor at enhanced efficiency compared to that of conventional capacitors. The electrochemical competence of the electrode was established through cyclic voltammogram, (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectral (EIS) studies. The values of capacitance for Ni1-xMnxO, (0.15 <= X <= 0.5) nanoparticles varied from 7000 to 8000 mFg(-1), measured at 20 mVs(-1)scan rate in 1.0 M Na(2)SO(4)and the temperature dependent conductance property for Ni0.85Mn0.15O electrode verified the Arrhenius Equation. The synthesis of a biodegradable polymer, Poly Butylene Sebacate (PBS) employed as conducting polymer for ultra capacitor applications is comparatively superior and definitely provides an edge over other capacitors in existence which is predominanantly attributed to its biodegradability nature. Further, the specific capacitance of PBSNi0.85Mn0.15O composite electrode was found to be 5180 mFg(-1) which clearly illustrates that these composites are potential candidates of the type biodegradable supercapacitors that are evolving transient sources of power in the future and the biodegradability of the polymer-metal oxide composite electrode fetches more significance in terms of disposal of electronic and electrical wares.

However, the effects of such coupled practices on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and production yields in vegetable fields are not clear. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to (1) understand methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in response to the same amounts of straw return with varied amounts of mineral fertilizers, and (2) to identify a solution which could better coordinate GHG emissions, vegetable production yield, and the utilization of agricultural straw following disposal. Materials and methods We conducted four-season (lettuce-cabbage-chili-lettuce) vegetable cultivation for 1 year using a control treatment (CT), mineral fertilization only (F), and four mineral fertilization treatments plus maize straw (FS, 0.7FS, 0.6FS, and 0.5FS). We then examined seasonal changes of CH4 and N2O fluxes, CH4 and N2O cumulative emissions, soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) content, vegetable yields, global warming potential (GWP), greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI), and N2O emission factors (EF). Results and discussion Compared to the F treatment, the application of maize straw increased the N2O flux significantly in the FS, 0.7FS, 0.6FS, and 0.5FS treatments. In treatments with added straw, the reduced application of mineral fertilizer led to a reduction in the cumulative N2O emission; this was due to the reduced content of NO3--N content. The lowest CH4 flux and cumulative CH4 emission were observed in the 0.7FS treatment; this may be due to a form of competitive oxidation between CH4 and NH4+-N from urea. Furthermore, the application of maize straw in combination with a full dose of mineral fertilizers led to high GWP and GHGI values, which showed increases of 88.7% and 78.8%, respectively, in comparison with the F treatment. When taking SOC storage variations into account, which were caused by straw decomposition during cultivation, we identified a negative net GHGI (NGHGI) value (- 0.0448 kg CO2-eq kg(-1) yield) in the 0.7FS treatment. This indicated that the NGHGI had decreased by 116.2% relative to the F treatment when based on similar vegetable yields. Conclusions Straw combined with 70% mineral fertilizer led to better GHG emissions and vegetable yield when taking into account the carbon sequestration and decomposition caused by the addition of straw.

In this study, aqueous solutions of dialdehyde cellulose (DAC) with various degrees of oxidation (DOs) and distinct concentrations were evaluated as robust adhesives for wood bonding, which has not yet been systematically studied. The adhesion performance of DAC adhesives was investigated using tensile shear strength measurements according to European standard EN302-1. Results showed the DO and the concentration of DACs had a predominant impact on the adhesion performance. The optimal formulation of DAC adhesives was found to be the aqueous solutions of DAC with a DO of 1.75 and a concentration of 40 wt %. The corresponding best bonding performance was represented by the bonding strength of about 9.53 MPa for beech wood specimens and 5.75 MPa for spruce wood specimens. Furthermore, wood specimens in shear strength tests mainly revealed a substrate failure mode rather than adhesive or cohesive failure. This indicates that the DAC adhesives possessed a stronger bonding strength than the wood itself. Therefore, our study demonstrates that DAC is a potential bio-based adhesive for wood bonding, especially under indoor conditions.

J	Gu, WW; Song, Y; Liu, JJ; Wang, F				Gu, Weiwei; Song, Ye; Liu, Jingjun; Wang, Feng			Lanthanum-Based Compounds: Electronic Band-Gap-Dependent Electrocatalytic Materials for Oxygen Reduction Reaction	CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL												The electronic energy level of lanthanum compounds plays an important role in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalytic process. In this work, three lanthanum compounds, LaOHCO3, La2O2CO3, and La2O3, have been synthesized through an in situ urea hydrolysis method, followed by annealing at different temperatures. Among these lanthanum compounds, the layer-structured La2O2CO3 has the smallest band gap and moderate values of the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB). Electrochemical measurements in 0.1m KOH solution have shown that, compared with the other catalysts, La2O2CO3 exhibits the best electrocatalytic activity with the lowest H2O2 production and highest durability for ORR, which proves the close correlation between electronic energy level and electrocatalytic ORR activity. During the ORR process over La2O2CO3, some covalent electrons from the VB are first excited to the CB and then transfer to the unoccupied *(2p) orbitals of an active oxygen molecule, leading to strengthened oxygen adsorption and promotion of the reduction of oxygen. Moreover, La2O2CO3 has an ability to chemically disproportionate hydrogen peroxide (to give HO2-), and the produced HO2- at the energy level of O-2/HO2- can undergo prompt chemical disproportionation into O-2 and OH-. The O-2 generated at this stage is adsorbed on the catalyst surface, which can be utilized for further oxygen reduction.

In most cases, however, sacrificial electron donors such as triethanolamine are required for the water-splitting operation, and nonsacrificial H-2 evolution by g-C3N4 remains a challenge. In this work, we investigated the photocatalytic activities of carbon nitride nanosheet (NS-C3N4), which was prepared by thermal treatment of urea, for nonsacrificial Hz evolution using reversible electron donors under visible light (lambda > 400 nm). Whereas Pt-loaded NS-C3N4 did not produce Hz from aqueous solutions containing I-, Fe2+, or [Fe(CN)(6)](4-), modification of the Pt/NS-C3N4 photocatalyst with CrOx led to observable H-2 evolution. Transmission electron microscopy observations and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic analysis suggested that a Pt-core/CrOx-shell structure was formed on the NS-C3N4. The CrOx/Pt/NS-C3N4 served as a H-2-evolution photocatalyst for visible-light-driven Z-scheme overall water splitting, in combination with a modified WO3 photocatalyst, in the presence of a [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) redox mediator.

The catalytic activity of each catalyst was estimated for the catalytic combustion of vinyl chloride (VC) emissions. The crystallite size of the Co3O4 catalyst was found to be well correlated with the amounts of surface-adsorbed oxygen species and number of acid sites on the catalyst surface, and consequently, determined several physicochemical properties of the catalyst. Of the catalysts studied here, the Co-AP catalyst exhibits the smallest crystallite size, which increases the specific surface area and the concentration of Co(2+)on the catalyst surface. This, in turn, enhances the redox property, oxygen mobility, and the number of acid sites associated with the Co-AP catalyst. In fact, the Co-AP catalyst exhibits the best catalytic activity for VC combustion at 360 degrees C and does not produce any chlorinated by-products. [GRAPHICS] .

Palladium-Coated Submicron Electrospun Polymeric Fibers with Immobilized Uricase for Uric Acid Determination in Body Fluids	ACS APPLIED POLYMER MATERIALS												This work describes the development of a flexible uric acid (UA) biosensor based on palladium-coated submicrometer electrospun poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) fibers metalized with gold and attached to polyethylene terephthalate substrate (Pd/Au/PMMA/PET). The morphological characterization conducted by scanning electron microscopy revealed nanoscale Pd dendritic structures. Electrochemical investigations in the absence and in the presence of redox probes demonstrated that these Pd nanostructures are responsible for a six-fold increase in the electroactive area and enhanced electron transfer kinetics when compared to the gold-coated electrospun fibers. The UA biosensor obtained by immobilizing the uricase enzyme (UrOx) onto the Pd/Au/PMMA/PET electrode surface, allowed UA detection with a sensitivity of 431 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1) and a limit of detection of 12 mu M. Investigation of the redox reactions of hydrogen peroxide (a product of the enzymatic oxidation of UA by UrOx) at the Pd/Au/PMMA/PET electrode demonstrated that the working principle of the biosensor is based on the reduction of PdO produced at the electrode surface during the spontaneous reduction of hydrogen peroxide on Pd. This allows a biosensor operating potential of -0.05 V (vs Ag/AgCl) with high selectivity. The UrOx/Pd/Au/PMMA/PET biosensor was applied for UA detection in body fluids (sweat, urine, and blood serum) with recovery values between 98 and 105%, which were validated by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. The stability of the device was evaluated over a period of 3 months, retaining 78% of the initial sensitivity, and reproducibility with RSD = 4.9% was achieved. The analytical performance of the biosensor under harsh mechanical deformations and at physiological temperatures demonstrated the potential applications of the device to wearable sensing platforms.

The mitochondrial enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is central for hepatic ammonia detoxification by deaminating excessive amino acids toward ureagenesis and preventing hyperammonemia. The present study investigated the early adaptive responses to changes in dietary protein intake in control mice and liver-specific GDH KO mice (HepGlud1-'-). Mice were fed chow diets with a wide coverage of protein contents; i.e., suboptimal 10%, standard 20%, over optimal 30%, and high 45% protein diets; switched every 4 days. Metabolic adaptations of the mice were assessed in calorimetric chambers before tissue collection and analyses. HepGlud1-'- mice exhibited impaired alanine induced gluconeogenesis and constitutive hyperammonemia. The expression and activity of GDH in liver lysates were not significantly changed by the different diets. However, applying an in situ redoxsensitive assay on cryopreserved tissue sections revealed higher hepatic GDH activity in mice fed the high-protein diets. On the same section series, immunohistochemistry provided corresponding mapping of the GDH expression. Cosinor analysis from calorimetric chambers showed that the circadian rhythm of food intake and energy expenditure was altered in ted from carbohydrate to amino acid oxidation when diet was switched to high protein content. This shift was impaired in Hep-Glud1-'- mice and consequently the spontaneous physical activity was markedly reduced in GDH KO mice. These data highlight the central role of liver GDH in the energy balance adaptation to dietary proteins.

Voltammetric determination of creatinine using a gold electrode modi fi ed with Na fi on mixed with graphene quantum dots-copper	JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Creatinine levels in blood and urine can be used as an important biomarker for the diagnosis of renal, thyroid, and muscle malfunctions. In this work, a square-wave voltammetric method for creatinine was developed using a gold electrode modified with a film composed by Nafion mixed with a graphene quantum dots dispersion prepared in the presence of Cu2+. Such Au/Nafion-GQDs-Cu electrode relies on the interactions of creatinine with Cu2+ released from the oxidation of Cu thus decreasing the characteristic Cu/Cu2+ anodic peak at +350 mV. A linear response was obtained for the analyte in the concentration range from 1.0 x 10(-6) mol L-1 (0.11 mg L-1) to 4.5 x 10(-4) mol L-1 (50.9 mg L-1).

P.			Ozone membrane contactor for tertiary treatment of urban wastewater: Chemical, microbial and toxicological assessment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A membrane ozone contactor, operated under continuous mode, was applied to promote the tertiary treatment of urban wastewater (UWW), targeting the removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), bacterial disinfection, and toxicity reduction. This system relies on the homogeneous radial distribution of ozone (O3) in the reaction zone by "titration" through a microfiltration borosilicate tubular membrane, while the UWW swirls around the membrane and drags the O3 microbubbles generated in the membrane shell-side. The membrane is coated with titanium dioxide (TiO2-P25) and radiation can be externally supplied via four UV lamps. The ozonation tests were carried out with secondary-treated UWW collected in different seasons (winter and summer) and spiked with a mix of 19 CECs (10 & mu;g L-1 each). For an O3 dose of 18 g m-3, the best performance was obtained by increasing the O3 concentration (maximum [O3]G,inlet of 200 g Nm-3) and decreasing the gas flow rate (minimum QG of 0.15 Ndm3 min-1), providing the highest ozone transfer yield (88 %) and, thus higher specific ozone dose (g O3 per g dissolved organic carbon). Under these conditions, removals >80 % or concentrations below the limit of quantification were obtained for up to 13 of the 19 CECs and reductions up to 5 log units for total heterotrophs and below the limit of detection for enterobacteria and enterococci. Tests including a UVC dose of 0.10 kJ L-1 enhanced disinfection ability but had no impact on CECs oxidation. After ozonation, the abundance of antibiotic resistant bacteria was reduced but not elimi-nated , microbial regrowth after 3-day storage was observed. No toxic effect was detected on zebrafish embryos using a dilution factor of 4 for the ozonized UWW , when granular activated carbon adsorption was subsequently applied the dilution factor decreased to 2.

The Se/N codoped photocatalysts were prepared through a simple wet-impregnation method followed by heat treatment using SeCl4 and urea as the dopant sources. The prepared photocatalysts were well characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy. The codoped samples showed photoabsorption in the visible light range from 430 nm extending up to 580 nm. The photocatalytic activity of the Se/N codoped photocatalysts was evaluated by degradation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). The degradation of 4-NP was highly increased for the Se/N codoped samples compared to the undoped and single doped samples under both UV-A and sunlight irradiation. Aiming to determine the electronic structure and dopant locations, quantum chemical modeling of the undoped and Se/N codoped anatase clusters was performed using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with the hybrid functional (B3LYP) and double-zeta (LanL2DZ) basis set. The results revealed that Se/N codoping of TiO2 reduces the band gap due to mixing of N2p with O2p orbitals in the valence band and also introduces additional electronic states originating from Se3p orbitals in the band gap.

Here, we found, unexpectedly, that HO center dot can be generated from H2O2 and thiourea dioxide (TUO2), a widely used and environmentally friendly bleaching agent. A carbon- centered radical and sulfite were detected and identified as the transient intermediates, and urea and sulfate as the final products, with the complementary application of electron spin- trapping, oxygen-18 isotope labeling coupled with HPLC/ MS analysis. Density functional theory calculations were conducted to further elucidate the detailed pathways for HO center dot production. Taken together, we proposed that the molecular mechanism for HO center dot generation by TUO2/H2O2: TUO2 tautomerizes from sulfinic acid into ketone isomer (TUO2- K) through proton transfer, then a nucleophilic addition of H2O2 on the S atom of TUO2- K, forming a S- hydroperoxide intermediate TUO2- OOH, which dissociates homolytically to produce HO center dot. Our findings represent the first experimental and computational study on an unprecedented new molecular mechanism of HO center dot production from simple thiol- derived sulfinic acids, which may have broad chemical, environmental, and biomedical significance for future research on the application of the well-known bleaching agent and its analogs.

Then, gold nanoparticles were successfully loaded onto the B-dNAC and gold nanoparticles/B-dNAC nanocomposites (AuNPs/B-dNACNs) were obtained through the incorporation of chloroauric acid by a facile thermal reduction process.

A AuNPs/B-dNACNs modified glassy carbon electrode (AuNPs/B-dNACNs/GCE) was constructed. The electrochemical behavior of 4-aminophenol (4-AP) on the AuNPs/B-dNACNs/GCE was investigated by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The AuNPs/B-dNACNs/GCE exhibited good electrocatalytic performance for the electrooxidation of 4-AP and can be used as a novel electrochemical sensor for the detection of 4-AP. Under optimal conditions, the linear range of 4-AP was 1-400 mu M, with a low detection limit of 0.61 mu M. In addition, it displayed good selectivity, reproducibility and stability. Most importantly, the AuNPs/B-dNACNs/GCE could be used for the determination of 4-AP in acetaminophen tablets, and good recovery was obtained in the range of 97.1%-104.9%.

Photocatalytic degradation of indoor VOCs holds great prospects in addressing these health concerns in daily life. However, traditional photocatalysts have a large recombination rate of charge carriers and a decrease of the photocatalytic degradation efficiency under high relative humidity. Herein, uniform tungsten oxide nanoparticles with enriched oxygen vacancies (WO3-U) were synthesized by a direct annealing method with urea addition, which exhibited superior performance in the visible-light photocatalysis. The reaction rate constant value of photocatalytic acetaldehyde degradation over WO3-U catalyst was above 3 times higher than that of pristine WO3 sample. More importantly, the WO3-U catalyst maintained stable and excellent photocatalytic performance at relative humidity range of 25-100 %. Except for the enhanced photogenerated charges separation, abundant oxygen vacancies could effectively accelerate O-2 activation to generate center dot O-2(-), which accounted mainly for the initial conversion of acetaldehyde. Then the subsequent transformation of center dot O-2(-) into center dot OH to promoted the final mineralization of acetaldehyde. In addition, the presence of oxygen vacancies also facilitated H2O dissociation to form surface hydroxyl groups, which increased the adsorption of acetaldehyde, resulting in the consistent photocatalytic performance of WO3-U catalyst within a wide humidity range. This work provides guidelines to design visiblelight responsive photocatalysts with efficient activity at high humidity conditions for indoor VOCs degradation.

Thermodynamic studies were conducted on the synthesis of cobalt nanoparticles using cobalt nitrate as a metal precursor in presence of different reducing agents; hydrazine, glycine, urea and citric acid. Thermodynamic results along with experimental characterizations show that the type and amount of fuel influence the adiabatic combustion temperature and the gases released during synthesis process affecting nanoparticle size, porosity and microstructure. The synthesized nanoparticles were activated by passing H-2 at 300 degrees C inside the reaction chamber before being used for studying the reaction pathway of catalytic dehydrogenation of ethanol. These studies indicate that cobalt catalyst is selective for aldehyde and acetate species along with the formation of H-2, H2O and CO2. Production of methane was also observed on cobalt surface at 400 degrees C. The spent catalyst nanoparticles were characterized after the reaction using XRD, SEM and TEM to analyze the particle size and its morphology. Results indicate a growth in particle size due to sintering, and carbon formation on the catalyst surface due to coking during ethanol dehydrogenation reaction.

Versatile products can be readily derived by hybridization, anion-exchange, surface modification, self-assembly, etc. More importantly, LMHs can be artificially exfoliated into unilamellar nanosheets with a molecular-level thickness of about 1 nm versus 2D lateral size in submicrometer or micrometer scale. Molecular-scale assembly can be then applied to fabricate superlattice-like composites and functional nanofilms with high quality. The hydroxides can be transformed into oxides, nitrides, or other compounds via different preparation procedures, which can further extend their application prospects. In this regard, the most promising electrocatalysis-related applications of LMHs and their derivatives are reviewed, such as oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, alcohol or urea electrooxidation, etc. At last, future challenges are also discussed from the aspect of synthesis and application, as well as encouraging advancements are anticipated.

However, only a few reports focused on the synthesis of NbN materials with different morphologies due to their harsh nitridation conditions. Herein, we successfully prepared amorphous NbN, spherical NbN (NbN-S) and nanobelt NbN (NbN-B) from different niobium precursors with corresponding morphologies by using urea as a nitrogen source at 750 degrees C. Comprehensive characterization (including XRD, N-2 sorption measurements, ICP-AES, FTIR spectroscopy, TG analysis, SEM, TEM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)) revealed the formation of NbN and the structural information of these NbN materials. Based on these characterizations, we found that the amount of surface Nb-OH groups is an important factor for successful nitridation under mild conditions. Moreover, the synthesized NbN materials can be used in the epoxidation of cyclooctene and a very high epoxycyclooctane yield (93.9%) was achieved, which is much higher than that over the corresponding Nb2O5 materials. This excellent catalytic performance of NbN materials is supposedly related to the low-coordinated Nb sites and rich vacancies generated during the special nitridation process.

This device combines an integrated microelectrode with a pH-sensitive chemical field effect transistor (pH-ChemFET). Thus, by triggering electrolysis phenomena owing to the integrated microelectrode, associated local pH variations in microvolumes are monitored thanks to the pH-ChemFET microdevice. Taking into account (electro) chemical reactions and diffusion phenomena in the liquid phase, the proposed model points out the role of the ElecFET geometrical design (microelectrode width w, gate sensitive radius re and distance between the pH-ChemFET gate and the microelectrode d), as well as polarization parameters, (polarization voltage V-p and time t(p)), on the microsensor response. It is first applied to water electrolysis in order to validate pH impulsional variations in microvolume. Then, the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide in phosphate buffer (PBS, pH(0) = 7.2) solutions is studied, evidencing the H2O2 potentiometric detection in the [10-100 mM] concentration range. This developed model paves new ways for sensor applications, opening several new opportunities for pH-ElecFET devices for H2O2-related enzymatic detection of biomolecules.

In this work, a novel wide-spectrum-response oxygen-rich double direct Z-scheme heterojunction-structured photocatalyst, g-C3N4 (precursor: urea, CN-U)/g-C3N4 (precursor: thiourea, CN-T)/Bi2WO6 (UTB), was prepared. The ternary system was confirmed by structural analysis and surface and morphological studies. The photocatalytic performances of the synthesized catalysts were estimated by photodegrading rhodamine B (RhB) solution. A more than 92 % mineralization and improved photocatalytic activity were achieved. UTB showed an outstanding photocatalytic performance for RhB degradation compared to CN-T, CN-U, Bi2WO6, and their binary nanocomposites.The improved photocatalytic properties and nmore than 92 % mineralization were attributed to the double direct Z -scheme and oxygen vacancies, which maintained the outstanding redox capability of the electrons, expanded the range of light absorption, and facilitated the separation of photogenerated carriers. This study has demonstrated the prospect in obtaining a double Z-scheme structured photocatalysts with simultaneously high redox potential and narrow Eg. This work has also offered a new strategy for fabricating low-consumption and efficient pho-tocatalysts that mineralize more than 92 % of organic pollutants without existing intermediates.					wei, li/GSD-3630-2022; liu, kaiyuan/JHU-0258-2023	CHEN, FUMING/0000-0002-0108-9831													2452-2627					SEP	2022	35								100419	10.1016/j.flatc.2022.100419	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flatc.2022.100419		AUG 2022											WOS:000853377400001

Pt-Co and Pt-Ni Catalysts of Low Metal Content for H2 Production by Reforming of Oxygenated Hydrocarbons and Comparison with Reported Pt-Based Catalysts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												New catalysts of Pt, PtNi, PtCo, and NiCo supported on Al2O3 were developed for producing hydrogen by aqueous phase reforming (APR) of oxygenated hydrocarbons. The urea matrix combustion technique was used for loading the metal on the support in order to improve several aspects: increase both the metal-support interaction and the metal dispersion and decrease the metal load. The catalysts were characterized by MS/ICP, N-2 adsorption, XRD, TPR, CO chemisorption, and the test of cyclohexane dehydrogenation (CHD). The APR of a solution of 10% mass ethylene glycol (EG), performed in a tubular fixed bed reactor at 498 K, 22 bar, WHSV = 2.3 h(-1), was used as the main reaction test. After 10 h on-stream, the catalysts prepared by UMC had better hydrogen yield and catalytic stability than common catalysts prepared by IWI. The UMC/IWI H-2 yield ratio was 23.5/15.2 for Pt, 24.0/17.0 for PtCo, 26.6/21.0 for PtNi, and 8.0/3.9 for NiCo. Ni or Co addition to Pt increased the carbon conversion while keeping the H-2 turnover high. Cobalt also improves stability. Reports of several authors were revised for a comparison. The analysis indicated that the developed catalysts are a viable and cheaper alternative for H-2 production from a renewable resource.

Re-examining Peak Assignment and Quantification Using Model Compounds	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												Heptazine-based compounds, often classified as graphitic carbon nitride or the g-C3N4 family of materials, have attracted a significant amount of attention since the seminal report on their photocatalytic reactivity. To achieve further progress, a better understanding of their structure-property-function relationship is necessary, which requires the development of analytical methodologies for characterizing their structure. In this work, we assessed the suitability of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for the analysis of g-C3N4 materials, especially their crystallographic defects that have been implicated in the photocatalytic mechanism. Using molecular model compounds and following the latest recommendation of sample mounting, we first determined the binding energies of key functional groups, which were then used to analyze the XPS spectra of melon, the archetype g-C3N4 material. Extensive signal overlaps prevented the resolution of -NH-, -NH2, and "defect" moieties such as guanidine and nitrile/cyanamide, though urea-like defects may be discernible in the O 1s spectrum. Nevertheless, given that the quantitative uncertainty was estimated to range from 14% to 65%, structural information that can be obtained via XPS was therefore limited, necessitating additional analytical techniques for a more comprehensive characterization of g-C3N4 materials, especially for identifying the "defect" groups that are crucial to their applications.

However, its efficiency is relative slow in comparison with copper and cobalt oxide catalysts. In this study, iron oxide modified g-C3N4 catalysts (Fe2O3/g-C3N4) were prepared by a simple thermal treatment method using urea and ferric nitrate as precursors. The materials were thoroughly characterized by a variety of techniques and their activity was evaluated for degradation of Acid orange 7 (AO7) and other dyes under visible light irradiation in the presence of PMS, with nearly complete degradation of all the pollutants obtained within 40 min. The prepared Fe2O3/g-C3N4 catalysts were also proved more efficient than the single components and were stable during multiple runs. The enhanced photoactivity can be attributed to 1) the higher surface area, supplying more surface active sites and making charge carriers transport easier; 2) improved optical properties with narrower band-gap energies and increased visible light absorption efficiency, and 3) the participation of iron species in the reaction with production of more radicals. Thus, the low cost Fe2O3/g-C3N4 composites with a facile synthesis process are very promising photocatalysts for PMS activation and pollutants degradation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Sunlight-driven photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B dye by Ag/FeWO4/g-C3N4 composites	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A wide range of processes have been adopted for environmental remediation; among them, photocatalysis appeared as an appealing strategy for degradation of organic pollutants. Heterogeneous photocatalysis efficiently dissociates the charge carriers and helps in reducing the rapid recombination rate of charge carriers resulting in enhanced photocatalytic degradation. A semiconductor photocatalyst graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), when doped with metals or non-metals, showed increased degradation abilities. Hence, a ternary photocatalyst was synthesized by thermal condensation of urea coupled with ferric tungstate (FeWO4) and doped with a noble metal (Ag) resulting in visible light susceptive semiconductor photocatalyst Ag/FeWO4/g-C3N4. The characterization of the fabricated composite was done by Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray, and X-ray diffraction. The Ag/FWO/GCN was used to degrade the rhodamine B (RhB) dye. Under sunlight, Ag/FeWO4/g-C(3)N(4)showed enhanced photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B dye, which was ascribed to the change in bandgap and reduced charge recombination. The parameters used for the optimization of the photocatalyst were pH, catalyst dose, oxidant dose, and irradiation time. The composite (Ag/FeWO4/g-C3N4) showed similar to 98% degradation of RhB dye under optimized conditions (i.e., pH = 8, catalyst dose = 50 mg/100 ml, oxidant dose = 9 mM, irradiation time = 120 min and RhB conc. 50 ppm).

NMS14P, a novel bacterium for growth promotion of maize, chili, and sugarcane	PLOS ONE												A novel methylotrophic bacterium designated as NMS14P was isolated from the root of an organic coffee plant (Coffea arabica) in Thailand. The 16S rRNA sequence analysis revealed that this new isolate belongs to the genus Methylobacterium, and its novelty was clarified by genomic and comparative genomic analyses, in which NMS14P exhibited low levels of relatedness with other Methylobacterium-type strains. NMS14P genome consists of a 6,268,579 bp chromosome, accompanied by a 542,519 bp megaplasmid and a 66,590 bp plasmid, namely pNMS14P1 and pNMS14P2, respectively. Several genes conferring plant growth promotion are aggregated on both chromosome and plasmids, including phosphate solubilization, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis, cytokinins (CKs) production, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity, sulfur-oxidizing activity, trehalose synthesis, and urea metabolism. Furthermore, pangenome analysis showed that NMS14P possessed the highest number of strain-specific genes accounting for 1408 genes, particularly those that are essential for colonization and survival in a wide array of host environments, such as ABC transporter, chemotaxis, quorum sensing, biofilm formation, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. In vivo tests have supported that NMS14P significantly promoted the growth and development of maize, chili, and sugarcane. Collectively, NMS14P is proposed as a novel plant growth-promoting Methylobacterium that could potentially be applied to a broad range of host plants as Methylobacterium-based biofertilizers to reduce and ultimately substitute the use of synthetic agrochemicals for sustainable agriculture.

Ferrous ions that enter the protein's shell through hydrophilic channels are rapidly oxidized at dinuclear centers on the H-subunit before transfer to the protein's cavity for storage. The mechanisms of iron loading have been extensively studied, but little is known about iron mobilization. Fe(III) reduction can occur via rapid reduction by suitable reducing agents followed by chelation of Fe(II) ions or via direct and slow Fe(III) chelation. Here, the iron release kinetics from ferritin by FMNH2 in the presence of various chaotropic agents are studied and their in-vivo physiological significance discussed. Methods: The iron release kinetics from horse and human ferritins by FMNH2 were monitored at 522 nm where the Fe(II) bipyridine complex absorbs. The experiments were performed in the presence of different concentrations of three chaotropic agents, urea, guanidine HCI, and triton. Results and conclusions: Under our experimental conditions, iron reductive mobilization by the non-enzymatic FMN/NAD(P)H system is limited by the concentration of FMNH2 and is independent on the type or amount of chaotropes present. Diffusion of FMNH2 through the ferritin pores is an unlikely mechanism for ferritin iron reduction. An iron mobilization mechanism involving rapid electron transfer through the protein shell is discussed.					arosio, paolo/E-6817-2010	arosio, paolo/0000-0002-5343-8992; Bou-Abdallah, Fadi/0000-0002-8557-1827													0304-4165	1872-8006				DEC	2017	1861	12					3257	3262		10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.09.016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.09.016								28943300					WOS:000415778800016
J	Louca, S; Doebeli, M				Louca, Stilianos; Doebeli, Michael			Reaction-centric modeling of microbial ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The growth of microbial populations catalyzing biochemical reactions leads to positive feedback loops and self-amplifying process dynamics at ecosystem scales. Hence, the state of a biocatalyzed process is not completely determined by its physicochemical state, but also depends on current cell or enzyme concentrations that are often unknown. Here we propose a generic approach to modeling reaction networks of natural and engineered microbial ecosystems, that is able to capture the self-amplifying nature of biochemical reactions without explicit reference to the underlying microbial populations. This is achieved by keeping track of a system's "capacity" to perform particular reactions, rather than the cell populations actually catalyzing them. Our reaction-centric approach minimizes the need for cell-physiological parameters such as yield factors and provides a suitable framework for describing a system's dynamics purely in terms of chemical concentrations and fluxes. We demonstrate our approach using data from an incubation experiment involving urea hydrolysis and nitrification, as well as time series from a long-term nitrifying bioreactor experiment. We show that reaction-centric models can capture the dynamical character of microbially catalyzed reaction kinetics and enable the reconstruction of bioprocess states using solely chemical data, hence reducing the need for laborious biotic measurements in environmental and industrial process monitoring.

This composite was identified by using SEM and FT-IR techniques. The prepared DCF-imprinted polymer (MIP) was used for modification of carbon paste electrodes (CPEs) to fabricate a selective DCF electrochemical sensor. Electrochemical behavior of DCF on the investigated sensor and the optimization of the parameters affecting the DCF determination were screened by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The cyclic voltammogram of DCF showed an anodic peak current at about 0.5 V (vs. SCE). The calibration curve for DCF determination was obtained by applying the investigated sensor as working electrode in differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). A linear increase in the anodic peak current was observed in the range 5-80 mg L-1 of DCF. The corresponding limit of detection was calculated to be 1.1 mg L-1. The relative standard deviations of the inter- and infra-day analysis of DCF presented by the method were found to be as 2.43% and 2.47%, respectively. The selectivity of the investigated sensor was evaluated by its use for determination of DCF in the binary solutions containing DCF/glucose, DCF/urea and DCF/ascorbic acid. It was shown that the fabricated electrode can be successfully used for analysis of DCF in pharmaceutical and urine samples.

Isotype heterostructure of bulk and nanosheets of graphitic carbon nitride for efficient visible light photodegradation of methylene blue	RSC ADVANCES												Nanosheets of g-C3N4 were prepared by the ultrasonic treatment of aqueous dispersed bulk C3N4 for 10 h. The nanosheets have a comparatively larger surface area (121 m(2) g(-1)) than that of bulk C3N4 (18 m(2) g(-1)). Bulk C3N4 prepared by direct heating of urea has a band gap of 2.74 eV, whereas the nanosheets of g-C3N4 exhibited an enlarged band gap of 2.97 eV. The isotype heterostructure is fabricated by the solid-state mixing of bulk and nanosheets of C3N4 followed by ultrasonic treatment for dispersion. The heterostructure shows an effective band gap of 2.62 eV with an average charge carrier lifetime of 21 ns, which is longer than that of the bulk (13.2 ns) or nanosheets (17.4 ns) of g-C3N4. The heterostructure exhibits significantly higher visible light photocatalytic activity in the degradation of methylene blue (MB) over bulk or nanosheets of g-C3N4. The superior photocatalytic performance of the heterostructure is ascribed to band-bending at the interface that promotes molecular exciton dissociation and facilitates facile separation of charge carriers at the interface. From the results of photocatalysis, it is speculated that the photogenerated (OH)-O-center dot radicals in conjunction with H-center dot atoms take part in photocatalysis by N-deethylation followed by aromatic ring cleavage of the MB molecule.

Polyurea can be used in protective coating and impact mitigation applications but is inevitably exposed to harsh deployment conditions such as extended ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Terahertz-time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), and ExcitationEmission Matrix spectroscopy (EEMS) deciphered the effects of UV radiation on radiated polyurea samples under ambient and nitrogen -rich conditions. Samples were radiated continuously for up to 15 weeks in increments of 3 weeks. Comprehensive FTIR analyses revealed a monotonic increase in disordered hydrogen bonding as a function of exposure duration in an ambient environment. Otherwise, marginal changes were observed in UV -radiated samples under nitrogen. The hydrogen bond length exhibited significant variations in the former compared to their nitrogen atmosphere counterparts. The results infer the nitrogen shielding effect, protecting polyurea from the photodegradation and photo -oxidation observed in samples radiated under the ambient atmosphere. THz-TDS spectra affirmed the FTIR results by probing changes in the complex refractive index. Terahertz spectral peaks associated with torsional vibrations of intermolecular hydrogen bonds in polyurea were notably correlated with increased exposure duration in the ambient atmosphere. Changes in the complex index as a function of exposure duration under nitrogen are minimal. The excitation -emission spectra of polyurea samples reveal a strong fluorescent behavior in 9 -week and 12 -week ambient -exposed polyurea due to cluster -triggered emission mechanisms. The results synthesized based on three different spectroscopy techniques paint a holistic portrait of the adverse effects of extended ultraviolet radiation of macromolecules deployed in harsh environmental conditions.

Highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by using Rh as co-catalyst in the Cu/TiO2 system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												Cu/TiO2 was modified by adding Rh as co-catalyst and used as a highly efficient photocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. A low amount of Rh was loaded onto Cu/TiO2 by the deposition-precipitation with urea (DPU) method to observe the effect on the hydrogen production displayed by different samples. The Rh-Cu/TiO2 oxide structure exhibited a remarkably high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance, which was about twofold higher than that of the Cu/TiO2 monometallic photocatalyst. This outstanding performance was due to the efficient charge carrier transfer as well as to the delayed electron-hole recombination rate caused by the addition of Rh. The influence of the different parameters of the photocatalyst synthesis and reaction conditions on the photocatalytic activity was investigated in detail. Hydrogen evolution was studied using methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and butanol as scavengers with an alcohol:water ratio of 20:80. The methanol-water system, which showed the highest hydrogen production, was studied under 254, 365 and 450 nm irradiation; Rh-Cu/TiO2 showed high photocatalytic activity with H-2 production rates of 9260, 5500, and 1940 mmol h(-1) g(-1), respectively. The Cu-Rh/TiO2 photocatalyst was active under visible light irritation due to its strong light absorption in the visible region, low band gap value and ability to reduce the electron (e(-)) and hole (h(+)) recombination.

Phenol and Cr(VI) degradation with Mn ion doped ZnO under visible light photocatalysis	RSC ADVANCES												Mn ion doped ZnO with different percentages of Mn content (Zn0.9Mn0.1O (1), Zn0.8Mn0.2O (2), Zn0.7Mn0.3O (3), and Zn0.6Mn0.4O (4)) was synthesized via a solution combustion method, with urea used as the fuel. The optical, morphological, and structural properties were studied using Raman, UV-DRS, SEM, TEM, XPS, and powder XRD techniques. The average crystallite sizes of Zn1-xMnxO (1, 2, 3, 4), which are around 30-60 nm, were confirmed via powder X-ray diffraction studies, whereas transmission electron microscopy studies confirmed the formation of a ZnO wurtzite crystal phase. Scanning electron microscopy indicated the spherical morphology of the samples. Raman spectroscopy studies confirmed a decrease in oxygen vacancies with increasing Mn content, whereas confirmation of the doping of Mn ions into the ZnO lattice was obtained using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The band gap energies of samples were calculated using UV-DRS spectroscopy, whereas BET surface area measurements confirmed the surface area. The visible light activity of Zn1-xMnxO (1, 2, 3, 4) was identified through studies of phenol degradation and Cr(VI) reduction under visible light photocatalysis, which highlight that Zn0.8Mn0.2O (2) shows the best activity. Typical degradation profiles indicated that the simultaneous degradation of pollutants is more effective than the removal of individual pollutants.

Herein, Zr-thiamine is pyrolyzed with urea under N-2 atmosphere to prepare Zr-thiamine modified carbon nitride (Zr-Thia/g-CN) catalyst. The catalyst exhibits optimum Lewis acidity and basicity to produce excellent cyclic carbonate yields by the insertion reaction of CO2 into epoxide on a large scale under neat conditions in the absence of any cocatalyst under traditional thermal catalysis in 6 h. The catalyst exhibits similar cyclic carbonate yield under simulated light (250 W Hg lamp, lambda > 360 nm) in 24 h and, most importantly, under sunlight in 12 h in the presence of a low amount of cocatalyst (2.5 mol % with respect to epoxide) under ambient temperature, 1 bar pressure, and neat conditions. The catalyst is efficiently recycled up to 5 cycles in traditional thermal catalysis and photocatalytic conditions. The structure-activity relationship is established, and the reaction mechanism is proposed with the help of CO2 adsorption, CO2 temperature-programmed desorption techniques, acidity-basicity measurements, optoelectronic properties, control reactions, and catalytic activity data. The development of a single catalyst for catalyzing the same reaction under traditional thermal catalytic and sustainable photocatalytic conditions will attract researchers of different disciplines.

One-pot synthesis of Au/N-TiO2 photocatalysts for environmental applications: Enhancement of dyes and NOx photodegradation	POWDER TECHNOLOGY												Au/N-TiO2 photocatalysts with enhanced photoactivity thanks to nitrogen doping and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) controlled deposition onto titania have been obtained by means of a simple and innovative one-pot synthesis promoting synergetic activity between these two approaches. The activity of the materials under study was evaluated by methylene blue and NOx degradation tests as models of environmental remediation processes for water purification and air depollution. The use of a deposition-precipitation method employing urea allows obtaining Au/N-TiO2 photocatalysts containing 0.3 at.% of nitrogen and 0.5 wt% of gold. The results obtained confirmed that the presence of both, nitrogen and AuNPs, enhanced the TiO2 photoactivity increasing the photodegradation of the dye and NOx in a factor of 4.5 and 1.7, respectively. In particular, the AuNPs enabled the photoactivity under visible light and improved substantially the selectivity of the NO degradation process. The photocatalysts here proposed maintain their properties as they are integrated into a silica matrix producing a product with potential use for the coating of different substrates, such as building materials for application in urban areas and fabrics or foams for the photocatalytic filters production.

The catalysts were tested in dry reforming of methane (DRM) at 750 degrees C with a mixed flow of CH4/CO2/Ar = 10:10:80 and GHSV = 24,000 h(-)(1). The materials were characterized by means of N-2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction by H-2, temperature-programmed desorption of CO2, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry. 10Ni-Zr and 15Ni-Zr catalysts prepared by the one-step method exhibited higher activity, long-run stability, and selectivity of H-2/CO compared to 10Ni/ZrO2 catalysts. This could be ascribed to the smaller Ni crystallite size, increased specific surface area, and enhanced weak- and medium-strength basic sites over reduced 10Ni-Zr and 15Ni-Zr catalysts. The 10Ni-Zr and 15Ni-Zr catalysts demonstrated the suppression of metallic nickel sintering because of the formation of NiO-ZrO2 solid solution, leading to the stronger interaction between Ni and the ZrO2 matrix. Moreover, stability enhancement for these catalysts was possibly linked to a higher amount of adsorbed oxygen species, as confirmed by XPS.

However, naked BP is intrinsically characterized by easy oxidation (or natural degradation) and sedimentation inside the tumor microenvironment, leading to a short-term therapeutic and inhomogeneous photothermal effect. Development of BP-based nanocomposites for PTT against cancer therefore remains challenging. The present work demonstrates that green and injectable composite hydrogels based on cellulose and BP nanosheets (BPNSs) are of great efficiency for PTT against cancer. The resultant cellulose/BPNS-based hydrogel possesses 3D networks with irregular micrometer-sized pores and thin, strong cellulose-formed walls and exhibits an excellent photothermal response, enhanced stability, and good flexibility. Importantly, this hydrogel nanoplatform is totally harmless and biocompatible both in vivo and in vitro. This work may facilitate the development of BP-polymer-based photothermal agents in the form of hydrogels for biomedical-related clinic applications.					xie, zhongjian/K-7858-2016; Wang, Dou/V-4758-2019; Qiu, Meng/J-7264-2019; xing, chenyang/M-8765-2018; Dong, Biqin/M-7589-2016; zhang, han/I-8297-2015; Liu, Li-Ping/ADB-6833-2022; Chen, Shiyou/HJB-3373-2022; Liu, Quanbing/ABG-9548-2021; Liang, Xin/JCD-7988-2023; Li, Zhongjun/O-6249-2018	Li, Zhongjun/0000-0002-2399-1594													2192-2640	2192-2659				APR 11	2018	7	7							1701510	10.1002/adhm.201701510	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adhm.201701510								29508554					WOS:000430115400017

The morphology and composition of the synthesized products were characterized by different techniques. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and elemental mappings revealed that cobalt element is highly dispersed in the framework of g-C3N4. For the first time, Co-g-C3N4 was demonstrated to own dramatically enhanced peroxidase-like activity, compared with pure g-C3N4. Its activity is dependent on the content of cobalt doping, and the optimal content is 2.5% (Co-g-C3N4-2) based on the result of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. The catalytic kinetics reveals that Co-g-C3N4-2 has a higher affinity for the substrate 3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and similarly efficient performance in comparison to that of natural peroxidase. The proposed mechanism demonstrates that cobalt dopant facilitates the electron transfer of Co-g-C3N4 from TMB to H2O2, thus enhances its peroxidase-like activity. Based on the greatly enhanced peroxidase-like activity, Co-g-C3N4-2 is firstly used for wastewater treatment. With rhodamine B as a model, Co-g-C3N4-2 exhibits 11 times higher degradation rate than that of pure g-C3N4. This research will be helpful to improve the development of efficient artificial peroxidase mimic for removing contaminants from wastewater.																			2046-2069						2016	6	42					35568	35576		10.1039/c6ra02911f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra02911f													WOS:000374349600049

Hypochlorite exposure is known to cause oxidative damage to DNA and proteins. As a response to these effects, the metabolite profiles of organisms treated with sub-lethal doses of hypochlorite are assumed to be severely modified; however, the nature of these changes is hardly understood. Therefore, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry, we analyzed the time-dependent impact of hypochlorite exposure with a sub-lethal concentration (50 mu M) on the metabolite profile of the Escherichia coli strain MG1655. Principle component analysis clearly distinguished between the metabolite profiles of bacteria treated for 0, 5,10, 20, 40, or 60 min. Major changes in the relative amounts of fatty acids, acetic acid, and formic acid occurred within the first 5 min. Comparative gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the amounts of free methionine and alanine were significantly decreased in the treated cells, demonstrating their susceptibility to hypochlorite exposure. The concentrations of succinate, urea, orotic acid, 2-aminobutyric acid, and 2-hydroxybutyric acid were also severely affected, indicating general changes in the metabolic network by hypochlorite. However, most metabolite levels relaxed to the reference values of untreated cells after 4060 min, reflecting the capability of E. coli to rapidly adapt to environmental stress factors such as the presence of sub-lethal oxidant levels.

J	Shah, M; Mondal, P				Shah, Mumtaj; Mondal, Prasenjit			Optimization of CO2 reforming of methane process for the syngas production over Ni-Ce/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst using the Taguchi method	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												In the present study, Taguchi method-based design of experiment with L9 orthogonal array was implemented to optimize the process conditions for CO2 reforming of methane over the Ni-Ce/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst. The catalyst composition, catalyst reduction temperature, reaction operating temperature, and the CO2/CH4 ratio of the reactant gas were the control parameters. The performance index was considered as the response of the Taguchi experiment. The performance index was calculated by considering the product gas H-2/CO ratio, deactivation factor, carbon deposition, and maximum CH4 conversion. The catalysts were prepared in two steps using the evaporation-induced self-assembly and urea deposition-precipitation methods. The catalysts were characterized in their fresh and spent stages using various techniques like X-ray diffraction, N-2-physisorption, H-2 temperature-programmed reduction, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy, Scanning electron spectroscopy, Transmission electron spectroscopy, and Thermogravimetric analysis. The results showed that the operating temperature had the principal effect on the performance index. The optimal conditions from signal/noise ratio analysis were Cat3 catalyst with Ti/Zr ratio of 1:3, catalyst reduction temperature of 600 degrees C, the operating temperature of 800 degrees C, and feed gas ratio as CO2/CH4 = 2. Higher Zr content in the catalyst support and the lower reduction temperature favor enhancing the performance index. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, fast charge recombination caused intrinsically by the pi-pi conjugated electronic system severely limits its photocatalytic performance. Constructing carbon nitride photocatalysts with modulated electronic structures is thus a promising but challenging task. In this paper, carbon nitride with different microstructural features, such as degree of polymerization, hydrogen bonds, bandgap, structural defects and ratio of C/N, were synthesized by polymerization of different types of nitrogen-rich precursors. Synergetic reactions were rationally designed for hydrogen production and the efficient and simultaneous removal of multiple contaminants, using carbon nitrides as metal-free photocatalysts. The significant impact of hydrogen bonds on synergetic photocatalysis was comprehensively demonstrated. With the smallest amount of hydrogen bonds, carbon nitride derived from urea exhibited fast charge transfer between interlayers, which is a prerequisite for superior photoactivity. By contrast, the polymerization of melamine and cyanamide was favorable for the formation of abundant hydrogen bonds and intrinsic vacancy defects. It was found that the coexistence of nitrogen deficiency and oxygen-doped microstructures could facilitate the activation of oxygen molecules, and thereby contributed to their moderate photoactivity. This research provides fundamental insights into the microstructural engineering of carbon nitride for high-performance synergetic applications. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The catalyst was characterized by H-2-TPR, CO2-TPD, XRD, XPS, TGA, Raman, and TEM. On Ni-Mn-ZrOx catalyst, the catalytic activity increased with time on stream, while a decrease was observed on Ni-ZrOx catalyst. In order to understand this phenomenon, the catalysts were characterized at pre-reaction and during reaction for different time on stream such as 100 min, 300 min, and 480 min. According to the XPS results, it was shown that the Zr species on Ni-ZrOx were reduced during the reaction, whereas the Zr species was almost in equilibrium on Ni-Mn-ZrOx catalyst. In combining the results of XRD and activity in DRM, we can conclude that a stable ZrO2 structure on Ni-Mn-ZrOx catalyst might promote the redox of nickel species during the reaction, and further promote the redistribution of nickel species. However, on the Ni-ZrOx catalyst, the unstable ZrO2 support might result in a decrease of surface nickel content while an increase of Ni particle size, thus led to a decrease of activity for DRM.

J	Zhao, CK; Lin, XY; Su, XS; Zhang, SY				Zhao, Chongkai; Lin, Xueyu; Su, Xiaosi; Zhang, Shengyu			Efficient degradation of phenol in water by ball-milling modulated nitrogen-doped structured biochar	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												Presently, most kinds of biochar rely on the addition of transition metals to improve their electron transport capacity, thereby boosting the activation of oxidants. However, challenges such as the precipitation of transition metals and the chemical inertness of biochar are commonly encountered. Biochar with nitrogen-containing functional groups has emerged as a promising solution as oxidant activators. The nitrogen doping of biochar through ball milling is a straightforward, cost-effective, and efficient preparation method. To optimize the activation properties, a multi-step process involving roasting, ball milling, and tempering was employed to produce biochar. Sesame dregs was chosen as the precursor for this biochar. By optimizing the roasting temperature to 900 degrees C and using urea as the nitrogen source, biochar derived from sesame residue was successfully prepared. This biochar featured pyridine nitrogen as the primary functional group, exhibiting improved crystallinity and aromaticity. The activation of sodium persulfate (3.0 mM) with biochar eliminated phenol from wastewater with an initial concentration of 50 mg/L in just 15 minutes, achieving a remarkable mineralization rate of 96.77%. Even after undergoing six cycles of repeated use, the system consistently removed 97.73% of phenol within the same timeframe, maintaining a high mineralization rate of 86.77%. Notably, it was found that N-CN, N-6, and N-q were instrumental in stimulating reactive oxygen species (ROS), while <middle dot>OH, SO4<middle dot>(-), and O-1(2) served as the primary ROS responsible for degrading phenol. The research also revealed a linear relationship between active oxygen sites and oxidized substances, offering insights into the mechanism of phenol degradation.																			2213-2929	2213-3437				APR	2024	12	2							112397	10.1016/j.jece.2024.112397	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2024.112397		MAR 2024											WOS:001202739700001

However, there still remains a lack of molecular mechanism interpretation. Aim of the study: This study was aimed at investigating the mechanism of glutamate-induced toxicity in PC12 cells and the neuroprotective effect of ZZCD based on a novel strategy of the combination of cell metabolomics and pharmacology. Materials and methods: The PC12 cells were treated with glutamate to simulate neurotoxic cell model. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry based on cell metabolomics approach was performed to comprehensively investigate the molecular mechanism of glutamate-induced toxicity The cell viability and cytotoxicity analysis, the determination of glutathione reductase(GR), superoxide dismutase(SOD) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis analysis and western blot analysis were performed to evaluate the neuroprotection of ZZCD. Results: Forty metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers in model cells by principal components analysis(PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis(OPLS-DA). Glutamate decreased the GR and SOD activities, increased the level of intracellular ROS, activated the apoptotic pathway, and induced the changes of energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism. In addition, the extract of ZZCD could reverse the disturbed metabolic pathways by regulating those potential biomarkers and exerted anti oxidation and anti-apoptosis.

J	Esparza, Y; Ullah, A; Wu, JP				Esparza, Yussef; Ullah, Aman; Wu, Jianping			Molecular mechanism and characterization of self-assembly of feather keratin gelation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES												Protein gels with controlled viscoelastic properties could find numerous material and biomedical applications. Feather keratin is naturally abundant protein while its gelation property has not been explored. In this study hydrogel from fully reduced feather keratin was prepared by dialysis. The objectives of this work were to study the molecular mechanism of self-assembly of feather keratin gel and to characterize the structural and viscoelastic properties of hydrogels prepared under various pHs (3-9) and temperatures (50-90 degrees C). Re-oxidation of free cysteine thiols and formation of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bond were determined as the main stabilizing forces in self-assembly of feather keratin gel. Adding thiol blocking agent of N-ethylmaleimide leads to reduced storage modulus of keratin gel; gelation was completely inhibited at 82% blockage of free thiols. Increasing temperature decreased storage modulus, while gelation at pH 3 resulted in stiffer gels compared to pHs of 5,7 and 9. Feather keratin gels with tunable viscoelastic properties could find applications as engineered scaffolds for different tissues. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and element content analysis implied C atom replaced the original position of the bridging N atom to form CCN. Compared to g-C3N4, the absorption edge of CCN was red -shifted. As a result, the band gap of CCN was reduced, which improved the light absorption capacity of CCN and the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron -hole. Ultimately, the photocatalytic activity of CCN was finally boosted. CCN can effectively degrade SMX under visible light. Among CCN with various C dosage, when 0.05 g of barbituric acid was added in the preparation process, the obtained sample (CCN-0.05) exhibited uppermost degradation efficiency on SMX, which can reach 99.0 % after irradiation for 60 min. Additionally, the first -order kinetic reaction rate constant (0.086 min -1) was 8.9 times higher than that of g-C3N4 (0.0097 min -1). Electron paramagnetic resonance and trapping experiments showed that the dominant reactive species on SMX degradation were surface & sdot;O2- and photogenerated holes by CCN-0.05 under visible light. Moreover, CCN-0.05 can still achieve effective removal of SMX under actual water backgrounds and showed selective degradation on sulfonamides.

J	Zhang, R; Dong, JX; Gao, GL; Wang, XL; Yao, YF				Zhang, Ran; Dong, Jing Xian; Gao, Guo Liang; Wang, Xue Lu; Yao, Ye-Feng			Facile Synthesis of Amorphous C3N4ZnxOy (x, y=0.32-1.10) with High Photocatalytic Efficiency for Antibiotic Degradation	CATALYSTS												The development of novel, noble metal-free semiconductor catalysts with high efficiency is of great importance for the degradation of organic compounds. Among them, amorphous materials have been extensively studied for their unique and commercially useful properties. Here, a completely amorphous, noble metal-free photocatalyst C3N4ZnxOy(x, y = 0.32-1.10) was successfully synthesized from urea and ZnO by a simple high-temperature polymerization method. As the Zn content increased, the short-range ordered structures of the amorphous samples were still retained, as revealed by XPS, FTIR, and ssNMR. Meanwhile, the -CN(3)structures were observed to be gradually destroyed, which may make the amorphous state more favorable for photocatalytic reactions. Compared with g-C3N4, the amorphous samples showed significantly reduced intensities in the photoluminescence spectra, indicating that the recombination rate of the photo-generated charge carriers was greatly reduced. It was confirmed that the optimized sample (C3N4Zn0.61O0.61) achieved a photocatalytic efficiency of 86.1% in the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride under visible light irradiation within 1 h. This is about 2 times higher than that of both g-C(3)N(4)and ZnO. This study emphasizes the importance of the amorphous structure in photocatalytic reactions, and this synthetic strategy may provide an effective model for designing other novel catalysts.					gao, guoliang/LEM-5533-2024; Zhang, Ranran/KHC-6593-2024															2073-4344				MAY	2020	10	5							514	10.3390/catal10050514	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/catal10050514													WOS:000546007000068

Chary			Highly dispersed and ultra-small Ni nanoparticles over hydroxyapatite for hydrogenation of levulinic acid	REACTION KINETICS MECHANISMS AND CATALYSIS												Hydroxyapatite (HAp) supported nickel catalysts were synthesised via simple urea precipitation method with various nickel loadings ranging from 5 to 20 wt% and tested in vapour phase hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) under ambient pressure. The as-prepared catalysts were systematically characterized by using X-ray diffraction, UV-DRS, HR-TEM, SEM, BET surface area, TPR and TPD-CO2 techniques. The active nickel surface area and the Ni dispersion over the HAp support were measured by using H-2 chemisorption method. The XRD results confirmed that the nickel oxide particles were well dispersed over HAp support at lower loadings and NiO crystallites were formed at higher loadings. The HR-TEM images revealed that ultra small (2.49 +/- 0.4 nm) and homogenously distributed nickel nanoparticles are formed over 5 wt% NiHAp catalyst. Moreover, UV-DRS analysis is also confirmed the similar phenomena. The H-2-TPR analysis revealed that the presence of strong interaction between nickel particles and hydroxyapatite support was observed. Among several HAp supported Ni catalysts tested in this study, we found that 5 wt% NiHAp catalyst is the most active and selective due to the presence of high number of active surface Ni particles over HAp support and this was confirmed by the H-2 chemisorption analysis and HR-TEM.

J	Aziz, DM				Aziz, Dara Muhammed			Design and development of a novel Co-MOF catalyst for sustainable pyrimidine synthesis via the Biginelli reaction	APPLIED ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY												In this study, we introduce a novel porous metal-organic framework named Co2(bbda)2(DMF)2<middle dot>5H2O, or MOF-UoR-1, synthesized via hydrothermal techniques employing a unique Schiff base ligand. The framework underwent comprehensive characterization, confirming its microporous nature through gas-sorption measurements. MOF-UoR-1 demonstrated remarkable efficacy as a catalyst for the one-step synthesis of pyrimidine analogs. Structural validation of the synthesized pyrimidines was accomplished via 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses. Through systematic experimentation, the optimal catalyst dosage (40 mg) was determined, showcasing its effectiveness across various aldehydes, 1,3-carbonyl compounds, and urea substrates. Noteworthy is the broad applicability of this environmentally friendly protocol, which offers advantages such as high yields (96%), rapid reaction times (90 min), straightforward product isolation, and product purity without necessitating column chromatography. Furthermore, the catalytic integrity of the framework remained intact, enabling its reuse without compromising performance. This research presents a promising approach for the synthesis of pyrimidine derivatives, with significant implications for sustainable and efficient chemical synthesis methodologies. Unveiling its microporous structure, this metal-organic framework exhibits remarkable catalytic prowess, enabling the streamlined synthesis of pyrimidine analogs. With high yields, rapid reactions, and broad substrate compatibility, it heralds a new era of environmentally friendly catalysis. image					Aziz, Dara/IWM-2822-2023	Aziz, Dara/0000-0003-3362-6301													0268-2605	1099-0739				SEP	2024	38	9								10.1002/aoc.7615	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aoc.7615		JUL 2024											WOS:001258257400001

The titanate nanotubes were prepared by conventional hydrothermal treatment; as for Bentonite, it was first purified, acidified and then doped with silver particles. The Deposition Precipitation with Urea (DPU) method was selected for the preparation of metalized titanate nanotubes (TiNT) as well as Bentonite at 2 wt% of Ag. The prepared materials were characterized by different methods, namely RD/UV?vis, FTIR, BET, XRD, TEM, SEM and EDS. The characterization results showed that titanate nanotubes exhibit a hollow structure with inner and outer diameters generally equal to 3 and 9 nm, respectively. However, silver nanoparticles, with an average size of 2.1 nm, were well distributed over titanate nanotubes and Bentonite. The catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts was investigated by performing the one-pot three-component synthesis of isoxazol-5(4 H)-ones in water, at room temperature. An excellent yield (90%) was obtained for the synthesis of isoxazol-5-(4 H)?ones; this yield generally depends on silver content.

During the polymerization of g-C3N4 , oxygen doping brought about a richer pore structure, while ethanol and urea promoted the formation of sub-stable gamma-Bi2O3, and most importantly, these reactions were achieved simultaneously to successfully fabricate the all-solid Z-scheme structure. The obtained Bi/gamma-Bi2O3/ EtCN showed much higher activity in the visible-light photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) than that of g-C3N4 and EtCN, where the degradation rate of 0.03Bi/gamma-Bi2O3/EtCN was 15.67 times higher than that of g-C3N4 , showing excellent visible photocatalytic performance. The improvement of the activity of Bi/gamma-Bi2O3/EtCN mainly caused by the formation of all-solid Z-scheme heterojunction between gamma-Bi2O3 and EtCN with Bi as the electron shuttle, which broadened the light absorption range of the catalyst, promoted the effective separation of electron-hole pairs. It was also found that center dot O-2(-) played a major role and h+ played a secondary role during BPA degradation process using 0.03Bi/gamma-Bi2O3/EtCN as the photocatalyst, which confirmed the mechanism of Z-scheme heterojunction.

The as-prepared nanomaterials were used as high efficient, low toxic and cost catalyst for the synthesis of some organic compounds. Ni(NO3)(2) and some natural extract were used as a surfactant for the first time to synthesis NiO nanomaterials. A high synthesis yield (91%) was obtained for S-2. Rietveld analysis affirmed the cubic crystal system of the obtained NiO nanocatalyst. The morphology studies were carried out with the FESEM method and the images revealed a change from non-homogenous to homogenous spherical particles when the Barberryas was used instead of orange blossom surfactant. Besides, the images revealed that the particle size distribution was in the range of 20 to 60 nm. The synthesized catalysts were used for the first time in Biginelli multicomponent reactions (MCRs) for the preparation of 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-ones (DHPMs) under the present facile reaction conditions. High yield (97%) of the final product was achieved at the optimum condensation reaction conditions (Catalyst: 60 mg; temperature: 90 degrees C and time: 90 min) when ethyl acetoacetate/methyl acetoacetate (1 mmol), benzaldehyde (1 mmol) and urea (1.2 mmol) were used.

In this study, we investigated the impact of P. liquidambari on N dynamics,the abundance and composition of N cycling genes in rhizosphere soil treated with three levels of N (urea). Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and diazotrophs were assayed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis at four rice growing stages (SO: before planting, S1: tillering stage, S2: grain filling stage, and S3: ripening stage). A significant increase in the available nitrate and ammonium contents was found in the rhizosphere soil of endophyte-infected rice under low N conditions. Moreover, P. liquidambari significantly increased the potential nitrification rates, affected the abundance and community structure of AOA, AOB, and diazotrophs under low N conditions in the S1 and S2 stages. The root exudates were determined due to their important role in rhizosphere interactions. P. liquidambari colonization altered the exudation of organic compounds by rice roots and P. liquidambari increased the concentration of soluble saccharides, total free amino acids and organic acids in root exudates. Plant-soil feedback mechanisms may be mediated by the rice-endophyte interaction, especially in nutrient-limited soil.

The as-synthesized supported alloy catalysts of sizes between 2 and 8 nm were employed in the gas-phase selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. Their alloy nature was proved from characterizations including diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and CO adsorption tests, temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. It was observed that the synthesis method greatly affects the final surface constituent of catalyst Pd/Cu ratio and partial particle reconstruction occurs under CO exposure. The optimum catalyst constituent of Pd-Cu-0.06-Mn2O3 was selected since it provided excellent conversion with poor selectivity to unwanted butane. Selectivity of all of the catalysts directly correlated with increasing Cu content and Pd-to-butadiene conversion. The bioreduction-supported catalysts using SI with a Pd/Cu atomic ratio of 0.9:1.4 showed excellent balances between butadiene conversion of 99.1% and selectivity to total butene above 92%, which we attribute to repulsion to H and its neighboring adsorbed inherent C and N atoms with adjacent Pd atoms and alloy synergy. The IPC catalyst showed the worst performance but was highly selective to butenes. And the DCPVP and DPU catalysts with 100% conversion produced worse 1-butene selectivity.

J	Yan, H; Barbier, N				Yan, Hui; Barbier, Noemie			Vitamin C stabilized in lysozyme and CTAB aqueous solutions	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS												Vitamin C (VC) is an antioxidant and assists in treating cancer, but it hydrolyses and degrades in aqueous solutions due to oxidation and loses drug efficiency. It is critical to improve the stability of VC. Lysozyme (LYS) is a global protein and an enzyme, which is used as a model protein to probe the interactions of VC and protein relevant to VC degradation. Micellar solutions, formed by cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and water, act as micro-reactors to stabilize VC. UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopic methods arc applied to investigate the interactions that control the properties of the VC-LYS-CTAB ternary model system. including kinetics of VC degradation and conformation changes of LYS (unfolding and recovery). The results suggest that LYS stabilizes VC by forming a complex and LYS partially unfolds, and CTAB micelles can slow down the rate of VC degradation. VC is the most stable in the VC- LYS-CTAB ternary system among VC-LYS, VC-CTAB aqueous solutions, and pure water. The strength of interactions decreases in the order of: VC degradation, interaction of CTAB micelles and VC, interaction of LYS and VC, and the weak hydrophobic interaction between CTAB and LYS. The former two are the major factors that control the alleviation of VC degradation and the recovery of LYS conformation. This work provides fundamental insights for drug stability and delivery, and personal product field where vitamins, proteins and surfactants are used. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Herein, the single-atom Fe and N co-doped hollow carbon microsphere loaded g-C3N4 catalyst (HFeNC-g-C3N4) was prepared by an innovative cascade anchoring strategy using polystyrene as the hard template, iron phthalocyanine, polydopamine and urea as the Fe, N and C precursor, in which the in-situ generated g-C3N4 could not only effectively anchor Fe atom to create the well-dispersed Fe-N-x active sites, but also accelerate the electron transfer in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Taking advantages of such sequential protecting strategy, the as-synthesized HFeNC-g-C3N4 catalyst with single-atom Fe-N-x active sites, verified by XRD, XPS and HAADF-STEM, could work as an efficient Fenton-like catalyst for PMS activation, which achieved almost 100% removal of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) in 5 min with the turnover frequency calculated to be 34.6 times higher than that of the homogeneous Fe2+ catalyst. The mechanism of O-2(center dot-) dominated radical combined with nonradical O-1(2) pathway was confirmed by quenching experiments and ESR analysis, which might be interrelated to the improvement of pH adaptability and interference immunity of HFeNC-g-C3N4/PMS system. Overall, the present findings provided an innovation strategy for the synthesis of excellent single-atom Fe based catalyst in wastewater purification.

Studies on the formation and properties of polypyrrole doped with ionised -cyclodextrins: influence of the anionic pendants	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY												Polypyrrole films doped with sulfonated -cyclodextrin (PPy/s-CD) and carboxymethyl -cyclodextrin (PPy/CM-CD) were formed on electropolymerisation of pyrrole in a solution of the cyclodextrin sodium salts. Lower rates of electropolymerisation were evident with the carboxymethyl -CD and this was attributed to protonation of the carboxylate groups due to an increase in the interfacial pH at the electrode-solution interface. The PPy/s-CD and PPy/CM-CD films showed cation exchange behaviour with the ingress of Na+ and its associated water molecules on reduction. The PPy/CM-CD film showed less electroactive behaviour which may be related to the lower number of anionic pendants on the CM-CD or to the possible precipitation of the less soluble neutral CD which arises due to the protonation of the carboxylate groups. The PPy/s-CD showed a high capacitance of 6.0mFcm(-2) corresponding to a specific capacitance of 71Fg(-1) over a wide potential range extending from -0.60 to 0.60V vs SCE. Over-oxidation was observed at relatively low potentials, at about 0.60V vs SCE. A diffusion coefficient of 6.47x10(-6)cm(2)s(-1) and a rate constant of 3.73x10(-2)cms(-1) were obtained for the ferricyanide redox couple at the PPy/s-CD, indicating little or no inhibition of the ferricyanide redox reaction.

Recently, the electrochemical treatment of wastewater in membrane divided cells has been reported to be of superior efficiency with regards to chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal while producing fewer disinfection by-products. In this study, a reduction of all the major wastewater defining parameter in both the anode and cathode chambers of an Anionic exchange membrane divided electrochemical reactor (AEM-ECR) and a Cationic exchange membrane divided electrochemical reactor (CEM-ECR) were obtained after the electrolysis of real septage and septage that had passed a vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW), respectively. The results of these batch electrolysis experiments in AEM-ECR and CEM-ECR using septage as feed concluded that among the two studied membranes, AEM usage in ECR is optimal. The reduction in COD, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), and Total ortho-phosphate (TP) after electrolysis in AEM based ECR was found to be double that achieved in CEM-ECR. The charge supplied and power required were 7794 +/- 10 coulombs L-1 and 48 +/- 6.7 Wh L-1. Further, the results of the batch electrolysis experiments in AEM-ECR with VFCW treated septage as feed concluded that the optimum feed to the AEM-ECR is VFCW treated septage since the charge and power requirement for treatment of VFCW treated septage is 42.5 and 35% lower, respectively, to that required for septage for similar percentage reductions in COD, TOC, and TP. The charge supplied and power required was 4482 +/- 846 coulombs L-1 and 31 +/- 1.6 Wh L-1. Finally, the continuous flow experiments AC(AEM) and CA(AEM) concluded that, regarding the double-chambered membrane ECR, a feed flow mode from anode to cathode results in maximum reduction in COD, TOC, TP, and coliforms in a double-chambered membraned ECR. The power required for treatment was 21.2 Kwh/m(3).

Rational design and synthesis of desired electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance toward water electrolysis. Herein, by employing a tertiary amine triethanolamine with good chemical stability and slight alkalinity as the precipitant, we show a one-step route for the fabrication of hierarchical porous nitrogen-incorporated cobalt-iron (oxy)hydroxide (N-CoFe-OxHy) nanosheets with microporous, mesoporous, and macroporous structures in the catalyst. The as-obtained hierarchical porous N-CoFe-OxHy nanosheets possess a larger specific surface area, more active sites, faster charge transfer, and higher intrinsic activity than those prepared by using a conventional precipitant such as urea. The N-CoFe-OxHy catalyst exhibits a superior electrocatalytic OER performance with an overpotential of 253 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), a Tafel slope of 41 mV/dec, and long-term durability. Besides, such a hierarchical porous N-CoFe-OxHy OER electrocatalyst was applied in a two-electrode electrochemical cell with Pt/C as the cathode to generate hydrogen and a solar-to-hydrogen system, demonstrating a low cell voltage of 1.53 V at 10 mA/cm(2), an outstanding stability, and the feasibility of developing non-noble-metal (oxy)hydroxide OER catalysts in practical hydrogen production via solar-driven unbiased water splitting. This work affords a facile strategy to modulate the morphology and activate the intrinsic active sites toward the rational design of earth-abundant, low-cost, and high-efficiency catalysts for clean and renewable energy production.					ma, lianbo/GPX-1991-2022	Fei, Shunxin/0000-0001-9083-6984; Chen, Xiang/0000-0002-8480-4203; Ma, Lianbo/0009-0002-2520-6323													2574-0962					SEP 27	2021	4	9					8866	8874		10.1021/acsaem.1c01030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.1c01030		AUG 2021											WOS:000703338600021

Economical, green and efficient treatment methods are urgently needed. In this study, the magnetic N-doped iron sludge based biochar (N-BCFe) was prepared by a one-step pyrolysis method using the iron-containing sludge from groundwater treatment plants, sycamore leaves and urea as raw materials to active persulfate (PS) for TC degradation. The results show that under the optimal experimental conditions, the removal rate of 10 mg/L TC in the N-BCFe/PS system could reach 86.56% (120 min), accompanied by a 59.9% reduction in total organic carbon (TOC), and still 63.34% of TC was removed in the third recycle experiment. Combined with EPR, free radical quenching experiments and XPS spectra, it is confirmed that there are free radicals (SO4 center dot-,(OH)-O-center dot) and non-radical (O-1(2)) pathways in N-BCFe/PS system. And the former is related to Fe doping, while the latter is attributed to N doping (nitrogen-containing functional groups). Seventeen TC intermediates were identified by LC-MS technology, and three TC degradation pathways were established accordingly. Generally, this study illustrates the considerable catalytic potential of N-BCFe and provides valuable insights into the synthesis of catalysts prepared from iron-containing sludge as feedstock.					zeng, huiping/AAN-6826-2020; Lin, Da/JRZ-0235-2023														0959-6526	1879-1786				DEC 10	2022	378								134519	10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134519	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134519		OCT 2022											WOS:000880122000003

C.; Garcia-Perez, Victor I.; Zanella, Rodolfo			Metallic composites based on Ag, Cu, Au and Ag-Cu nanoparticles with distinctive bactericidal effect on varied species	MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS												Because the spread of antimicrobial resistance is impacting current health, environmental, and technological developments, the synthesis of novel and efficient antibacterial agents is required. In this work, nanoparticles of Ag, Cu, Au and Ag-Cu were supported on TiO2 Degussa P25 by the deposition-precipitation with urea method (DPU). The antibacterial performance of these materials, well known as catalysts of reactions of environmental interest, was evaluated against four different bacterial species; which are related to airborne (S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa) and waterborne (E. coli and S. aureus) infections. To know the minimum concentration of each composite in relation to the viability of the above mentioned microorganisms, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) technique was used. The model of this work standardized an inoculum volume of bacteria of around 10(4) bacterial cells per milliliter, which is the average bacterial load of microorganisms found in contaminated environments, the bacterial growth was followed for 24 h. The results showed that all the bacterial species were sensitive to the majority of composites, except to the Au-based composite, because most bacterial species were resistant to it. The highest bactericidal efficiency was obtained with the bimetallic composite AgCu/TiO2, which showed MBC values of 62.5 mM for both the S. aureus and P. aeruginosa species, and 31.15 and 15.6 mM for the E. coli and S. pneumonia species, respectively. The bactericidal effectiveness of all materials was ranked in the following order Ag/Cu > Ag > Cu > Au.

Developing an environmentally benign heterogeneous catalytic system for olefin epoxidation with high activity and selectivity is still a challenge in this research field. Herein, we report our attempts to synthesize novel zirconium phenylphosphonate-anchored methyltrioxorhenium (MTO/ZrPP) heterogeneous catalysts by a conventional impregnation method and evaluate their catalytic performance for epoxidation of cyclohexene using urea-hydrogen peroxide adduct (UHF) as oxidant without the addition of base ligands. The MTO/ZrPP catalyst samples are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-ES), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and solid-state H-1 magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 MAS NMR) techniques. Meanwhile, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation is carried out to further understand the structure feature and interactions of the MTO/ZrPP catalyst. It is revealed that MTO is anchored on support surface by the favored hydrogen-bonding interaction between two oxo ligands of MTO and two H atoms from the adjacent phenyls of ZrPP. MTO/ZrPP catalyst displays excellent catalytic activity for cyclohexene epoxidation. Moreover, only cyclohexene oxide production can be obtained under the employed reaction conditions.

The synthesized materials were characterized by TEM, ICP-OES, XRD, N-2 adsorption desorption, UV-vis spectrophotometry, XPS, and (photo)electrochemical measurements. The TEM images confirmed the close contact between ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles and showed that although Au nanoparticles agglomerated in the form of islands; they were widely dispersed on the surface of the photocatalysts. Besides, the XPS characterization revealed the enhanced contribution by the metallic Au species as their amount was increased in the composite. The heterojunctions with different Au contents produced higher yield in the photocatalytic production of hydrogen, observing a maximum with the 2 -wt.%-Au content (9.13 mmol g(-1)), being this value 6 times higher than the results obtained with the ZnO-TiO2 heterojunction. This improvement is associated with the synergistic interaction between the ZnO-TiO2 heterojunction and Au islands that promoted the separation and transfer of charge carriers. Besides, the (photo)electrochemical characterization showed that the islands acted as "electronic reservoirs", prolonging the lifetime of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs and creating surface or energy states at the Au/ZnO-TiO2 heterojunction interface. These states helped improve the charge transfer processes by diminishing the recombination and increasing the photocatalytic hydrogen production. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The most membrane distal part is a leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain responsible for both cis- and trans-interactions, whereas the membrane proximal part is a fibronectin type III (FnIII) domain responsible for a cis-interaction with members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) family, which results in PGFR tyrosine kinase activation. Whereas the structures of FLRT LRR domains from various species have been determined, the expression and purification of recombinant FLRT FnIII domains, important steps for further structural and functional characterizations of the proteins, have not yet been described. Here we present a protocol for expressing recombinant FLRT-FnIII domains in inclusion bodies in Escherichia coil. His-tags permitted affinity purification of the domains, which subsequently were refolded on a Ni-NTA agarose column by reducing the concentration of urea. The refolding was confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) and H-1-NMR. By thermal unfolding experiments we show that a strand-strand cystine bridge has significant effect on the stability of the FLRT FnIII fold, We further show by Surface Plasmon Resonance that all three FnIII domains bind to FGFR1, and roughly estimate a K-d for each domain K(d)s being in the mu M range.

Tungstic acid, sodium sulfate and urea were used as tungsten, sulfur and nitrogen sources, respectively. The morphology and microstructure characteristics of the photocatalysts were evidenced by means of XRD, BET, TEM, SEM and UV-vis DRS techniques. The XRD results show that the main crystal phase of samples is anatase. It was also found that the tri-doping of TiO2 increases its BET specific surface area from 95 to 121 m(2)center dot g(-1). Besides, it was shown that tri-doping narrows the band gap of TiO2 effectively, which has greatly improved the photocatalytic activity in the visible light region. The photocatalytic activity of tri-doped TiO2 powders was compared to that of bi-doped ones through the degradation of Congo Red (CR) under visible irradiation. Thus, the prepared 0.5% W-N-S-TiO2 heat treated at 450 degrees C showed the best photocatalytic activity compared to the prepared pure TiO2, Degussa P25, and co-doped samples (WNTiO2 and WSTiO2). In particular, a Congo Red degradation rate of approximately 99% was reached after only 35 min of visible light irradiation in the presence of 0.5% of WNSTiO2. Total organic carbon (TOC) removal of CR was up to 72% and confirmed its significant mineralization in the presence of 0.5% of WNSTiO2 photocatalyst. (c) 2015 Academie des sciences.

These complexes adopt a distorted six-coordinate octahedral geometry where ligands act as bidentate, coordinating through the two O atoms. These complexes have been used as catalysts to explore a single pot multicomponent (benzaldehyde or its derivatives, urea/thiourea and ethyl acetoacetate/phenyl acetoacatate) Biginelli reaction producing biologically active 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2-(1H)-one and 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2-(1H)-thione based biomolecules under solvent-free conditions. Presence of H2O2 improves the yield of dihydropyrimidin-2-(1H)-one but it acts as poison for the later molecule. Epoxidation of internal and terminal alkenes mainly resulted in the formation of the corresponding epoxide. The catalytic oxidative bromination of thymol, a reaction facilitated by vanadium dependent haloperoxidases, resulted in the formation of three product namely 2-bromothymol, 4-bromothymol and 2,4-bromothymol. Other phenol derivatives have also been brominated effectively.

Four kinds of La2O3 synthesized via the citric acid complex, KOH-K2CO3 co-precipitation, pyrolysis and urea method were used as supports of Ru-based catalysts by impregnation to investigate NH3 decomposition. We herein prepared all catalysts for the production of COx-free hydrogen from ammonia decomposition at 300-550 degrees C. Among the prepared formulations, the Ru/La2O3-700-i catalyst, prepared by a successive conversional impregnation method, shows the highest NH3 conversion (90.7%) with the GHSV of 18000 mL/g(cat).h at 525 degrees C, which is significantly superior to the Ru/La2O3-700-p synthesized via a one-step pyrolysis method. Through XRD and TEM studies, we identify a pure La2O3 phase formation that is responsible for the high catalytic activity of Ru/La2O3-7004 for ammonia decomposition. Moreover, the reaction TOF over the Ru/La2O3-700-i catalyst (1537.6h(-1)) is higher than that of the Ru/La2O3-700-p catalyst (1364.1h(-1)). The activity of Ru/La2O3-700-i catalyst is found to be even further enhanced in the presence of KOH.					haung, chuanqing/JFK-2376-2023; Wang, Xuewen/IXN-2647-2023; YANG, Xuemei/AAP-5141-2020; Hu, Feiyang/HSD-2475-2023; Feng, Gang/A-1945-2010	Feng, Gang/0000-0003-4828-5108													0169-4332	1873-5584				MAY 15	2019	476						928	936		10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.01.112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.01.112													WOS:000459458600110

SGLT2i improves renal outcomes in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, indicating it may have beneficial effects beyond glycemic control. Here, we demonstrate that SGLT2i affects energy metabolism and podocyte lipotoxicity in experimental Alport syndrome (AS). In vitro, we found that the SGLT2 protein was expressed in human and mouse podocytes to a similar extent in tubular cells. Newly established immortalized podocytes from Col4a3 knockout mice (AS podocytes) accumulate lipid droplets along with increased apoptosis when compared to wild-type podocytes. Treatment with SGLT2i empagliflozin reduces lipid droplet accumulation and apoptosis in AS podocytes. Empagliflozin inhibits the utilization of glucose/pyruvate as a metabolic substrate in AS podocytes but not in AS tubular cells. In vivo, we demonstrate that empagliflozin reduces albuminuria and prolongs the survival of AS mice. Empagliflozin-treated AS mice show decreased serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels in association with reduced triglyceride and cholesterol ester content in kidney cortices when compared to AS mice. Lipid accumulation in kidney cortices correlates with a decline in renal function. In summary, empagliflozin reduces podocyte lipotoxicity and improves kidney function in experimental AS in association with the energy substrates switch from glucose to fatty acids in podocytes.

J	Alizadeh, T; Zabihi, B; Amiri, A				Alizadeh, Taher; Zabihi, Behnam; Amiri, Ahmad			A novel L-Cysteine voltammetric sensor based on a dual-nucleation copper (II) complex	MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL												A novel platform of simple and cost-effective carbon paste electrode (CPE)-modified with a binuclear copper (II)8-hydroxyquinoline complex was used for catalytic electroxidation of L-Cysteine. The modified electrode described was observed to significantly reduce the electrooxidation potential of L-Cysteine. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed a significant decrease in the charge transfer resistance at the electrode surface by introducing the binuclear copper complex in the CPE. It was proposed that the two molecules of cysteine, adsorbed to the modified electrode surface, are oxidized to a cystine molecule via copper (II) centers of the complex which are consequently reduced to copper (I) species, responsible for the voltammetric peak observed when the potential was scanned toward the positive direction. To improve the electrode signal for cysteine, the electrode composition was also optimized. Two electrochemical techniques of cyclic voltammetry and amperometry were applied for the establishment of the calibration curve for cysteine determination by this electrode. The linear ranges of the calibration curves are obtained utilizing two electrochemical techniques of cyclic voltammetry and amperometry were 286-5000 mu M and 11.6-500 mu M, respectively. Also, the detection limits of cysteine assay by the above-cited techniques were calculated and equal to 86.7 mu M and 3.5 mu M, respectively. The electrode described was applied for cysteine determination in some vegetable samples which showed satisfactory results. Also, the selectivity of the sensor was checked against some biomolecules and amino acids such as Glycine, Alanine, Arginine, Methionine, Glucose, Urea, BrO3 - and Citric acid. The introduced sensor exhibited excellent selectivity for cysteine determination in food samples.

The possible mechanism was discussed from studies that corroborated or discarded the formation of the species center dot OH, center dot O-2(-) and h(+). RESULTS The addition of ZrO2 to Zn-5(OH)(6)(CO3)(2) resulted in a composite material with high photoactivity. The material containing 8 mol% of ZrO2 (ZnZr-8.0%) was the sample with the best percentages of photodegradation and mineralization. The photodegradation enhancement was achieved partly by an increment in the specific surface area and principally due to localized states originating in the composite interphase which improved charge transfer. XPS study revealed that the ZrO2 addition increases the oxygen vacancies which enhanced the organic molecule photodegradation via direct hole attack. CONCLUSION The ZnZr composite system constitutes an excellent alternative for the photodegradation of persistent organic pollutants due to the low cost, high stability and null toxicity of the support Zn-5(OH)(6)(CO3)(2).

The microwave treatment was performed in the solid phase using urea and ammonium nitrate as the promoter and oxidizer agents. The designed process allows rapid synthesis of large amounts of this product in nanosized particulate morphology. Morphological and structural features of the prepared products were studied in detail. Chemical analyses indicated a stoichiometry of (NH4)(0.5)Ni0.25AgPMo12O40 center dot 4H(2)O revealing a Keggin-type framework with substitution of silver and nickel cations in its secondary structure. A home-made set-up was used to test gasochromic effect via monitoring light intensity variations passing through the samples based on their color change during exposure to different H2S gas concentrations. Response in coloration was obtained about 12% to 61.8% for concentrations from 8.5 to 100 mg L-1. It is suggested that the presence of Ag and Ni ions (especially silver as counter cations) in the secondary structure of a Keggin ion plays an important role in the coloration effect of the substituted phosphomolybdate compared with the un-substituted one. In fact, color centers can be originated from the interaction of these cations of the phophomolybdate network with thiol functional group of H2S molecules. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Structural, magnetic and electrochemical characterizations of Bi2Mo2O9 nanoparticle for supercapacitor application	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS												In this present work, bismuth molybdate (Bi2Mo2O9) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by microwave combustion method using urea as the fuel. The phase formation and purity of the product was identified by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) analysis was adopted to record the functional group of Bi2Mo2O9 NPs. The morphology, purity, size and elemental composition of the sample were confirmed by Scanning electron microscope (SEM), elemental mapping, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and High-Resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) technique respectively. The UV-visible and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were used to examine optical and electronic behavior of the prepared sample at room temperature (RT). The chemical bonding of Bi2Mo2O9 NPs was studied by Raman spectroscopy. The magnetic properties of Bi2Mo2O9 NPs were examined by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) at RT. The particle size distribution was examined by X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Electrochemical (EC) properties of Bi2Mo2O9 NPs were investigated by Cyclic voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and Electrochemical impedance spectral (EIS) studies. The specific capacitance (C-s) of prepared Bi2Mo2O9 NPs is 197 F/g at 0.4 A/g with excellent cycle stability of 94% specific capacitance after 1000 cycles. Hence, the results of electrochemical characteristics exhibits excellent performance and have potential application of electrode for energy storage systems.

However, MD application to urine is limited by obstacles, including the inability to recover nutrients and water simultaneously, low separation efficiency due to ammonia permeation, and membrane fouling. Herein, a novel system integrating thermally activated peroxydisulfate with MD (TAP-MD) was devel-oped to overcome the above obstacles. The synergy effects were found between TAP pretreatment and MD process. With TAP pretreatment, membrane fouling was alleviated by organics degradation and mineral pre-cipitation reduction, resulting in significant improvements in MD performance. Water flux of pretreated urine decreased from 25 L/m2/h to 15 L/m2/h after 80 % of water recovery, but that of unpretreated urine decreased to near zero after 38 % of water recovery. Meanwhile, MD process revealed further enhancement in urine sta-bility by activating residual peroxydisulfate, reducing nutrient losses due to ammonia volatilization during storage and utilization of concentrated fertilizer. As a result, nearly 92.95 % of N-urea, 97.35 % of P, and 99.77 % of K was recovered as concentrated liquid fertilizer, meanwhile, 80 % of water was recovered as high-quality reclaimed water. The energy efficiency was improved by reusing waste heat from pretreatment. The TAP-MD system achieved a 45.63 % increase in thermal efficiency and a 38.25 % reduction in specific energy con-sumption compared to no pretreatment. This study developed an energy-efficient and high-performance sepa-ration treatment for complete resource recovery from urine.

Removal of carbonyl sulfide (COS) and methyl mercaptan (CH4S) over the hydrotalcite-derived oxides (HTO) at low temperature was studied. The Ni3Al-HTO exhibited higher catalytic activities than Ni3Al mixed oxides prepared by physical mixing method (Ni3Al-PM) or impregnation/calcination method (Ni3Al-IC). Based on the characterization, it was found that desulfurization activities are closely tied to the surface acid-base properties of catalysts. CO2-TPD indicates that the basic characteristic of the Ni3Al-HTO is prominent. XPS results showed that there was a strong interaction between Ni and Al element on Ni3Al-HTO. The first principle calculation based on density function theory was applied with the aim to study the change of basic sites. The results showed that Ni3Al-HTO presents a half-metallic characteristic. Electron transfer from the Al and O atom to the Ni atom was observed, which is helpful for the transfer of electrons from the surface and improves the catalytic activity. Analysis of the DRIFT spectra suggests that sulfate species was formed by the action of surface basic sites, resulting in the formation of H2O on the surface. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wang, BW; Yao, SM; Peng, YP				Wang, Baowei; Yao, Shumei; Peng, Yeping			Simultaneous desulfurization and denitrification of flue gas by pre-ozonation combined with ammonia absorption	CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												A process of simultaneous desulfurization and denitrification of flue gas was conducted in this study. The flue gas containing 200 mg.m(-3) NO, 1000-4000 mg.m(-3) SO2, 3%-9% O-2, and 10%-20% CO2 was first oxidized by O-3 and then absorbed by ammonia in a bubbling reactor. Increasing the ammonia concentration or the SO2 content in flue gas can promote the absorption of NOx and extend the effective absorption time. On the contrary. both increasing the absorbent temperature or the O-2 content shorten the effective absorption time of NOx. The change of solution pH had substantial influence on NOx absorption. In the presence of CO2, the NOx removal efficiency reached 89.2% when the absorbent temperature was raised to 60 degrees C, and the effective absorption time can be maintained for 8 h, which attribute to the buffering effect in the absorbent. Besides, both the addition of Na2S2O3 and urea can promote the NOx removal efficiency when the absorbent temperature is 25 degrees C, and the addition of Na2S2O3 had achieved better results. The advantage of adding Na2S2O3 became less evident at higher absorbent temperature and coexistence of CO2. In all experiments, SO2 removal efficiency was always above 99%. and it was basically not affected by the above factors.

The reported threshold ammonia value for stable biogas production varies greatly between studies, probably because of differences in operating conditions. Moreover, it is often difficult to separate the effect of ammonia inhibition from that of organic loading rate (OLR), as these two factors are often interrelated. This study attempted to distinguish the effects of ammonia and OLR by analysis of two laboratory-scale biogas reactors operating with thin stillage and subjected to an increase in free ammonia (from 0.30 to 1.1gL(-1)) either by addition of an external nitrogen source (urea) or by increasing the OLR (3.2-6.0g volatile solidsL(-1)d(-1)). The results showed that ammonia concentration was detrimental for process performance, with the threshold for stability in both processes identified as being about 1g NH3-NL-1, irrespective of OLR. Analysis of the methanogenic community showed limited differences between the two reactors on order level and a clear increase in the abundance of Methanomicrobiales, particularly Methanoculleus sp., in response to increasing ammonia concentration. Further comprehensive molecular analysis revealed that diverse Methanoculleus species dominated in the reactors at a given ammonia level at different OLR. The acetogenic community was clearly affected by both ammonia concentration and OLR, suggesting that the volatile fatty acid load in relation to the higher OLR was important for the dynamics of this community.

The structural, surface, optical and electric properties were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, UV-Vis DRS, PL, N-2 physical adsorption/desorption and electrochemical methods, which proved that this strategy of modifying g-C3N4 by nitrogen vacancies not only increased the specific surface area, exposed more active sites, but also inhibited the recombination of photogenerated carriers on the surface of photocatalysts, resulting in the enhancement of photocatalytic and electrocatalytic performances. The photocatalytic activities were measured under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm), and their degradation efficiencies could be achieved for 99.8%, 55%, 100% and 99.7% corresponding to that of rhodamine B, acid orange II, methyl orange and methylene blue, respectively. The trapping experiments demonstrated that center dot O-2(-) played an important role in the degradation process. In addition, being an active electrocatalyst, nitrogen-deficient g-C3N4 showed a lower Tafel slope, smaller overpotential and the more effective electrochemical surface area compared with that of bare g-C3N4 in neutral media. This work underlines the importance of defect engineering to promote catalytic performance, which can provide a simple and efficient way for modifying g-C3N4 and other N-based catalysts.

Through both dynamic fitting and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the critical role of edge nitrogenation in biochar (BC) structure was revealed for the first time. The incorporation of edge nitrogen configurations (pyridinic N and pyrrolic N rather than graphitic N) generated reactive sites for the PDS activation. Additionally, a thorough investigation was conducted to explicate the PDS activation mechanism by NBC through chemical quenching experiments, electron spin resonance (ESR) detection, oxidant consumption monitoring and electrochemical analysis. Different from the well-reported singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) dominated nonradical mechanism, an electron transfer pathway involving surface-bound reactive complexes was proved to play a major role in the NBC/PDS system. Benefit from the electron transfer mechanism, the NBC/PDS system not only has wide pH adaptation for real application, but also shows high resistance to the inorganic anions in aquatic environment. We believe this study will deepen the understanding of the carbon-driven persulfate activation mechanism and provide strong technical support for the BC-mediated persulfate activation in practical applications.

In outdoor pools, DHHB will inevitably interact with free chlorine and sunlight. Therefore, the mechanism of solar-chlorine chemical transformation of DHHB, as well as the environmental risk, were investigated in this work. In chlorinated with solar (Cl + solar) process, free chlorine was the dominant contributor to 85% of the DHHB degradation, while hydroxyl radicals and reactive chlorine species contributed only 15% because of low free radical generation and fast DHHB and free chlorine reaction rates. Scavenging matrices, such as Cl-, NH thorn 4 , and dissolved organic matter (DOM), inhibited the degradation of DHHB in the Cl + solar process, while Br-, HCO-3, NO-3, and urea promoted DHHB degradation. DHHB degradation was inhibited in tap water swimming pool samples, while it was enhanced in seawater pool samples by the Cl + solar process. Seven trans-formation by-products (TBPs) including mono-, dichlorinated, dealkylate, and monochloro-hydroxylated TBPs were iden-tified. Three degradation pathways, chlorine substitution, chlorine and hydroxyl substitution, and dealkylation were proposed for DHHB transformation in the Cl + solar process. Both Quantitative structure-activity relationship and Aliivibrio fischeri toxicity tests demonstrated increased toxicity for the chlorinated TBPs. A risk assessment of the DHHB and its TBPs suggested that both DHHB and its chlorinated TBPs pose a significant health risk.

Being different from the traditional solution combustion synthesis method, a cigarette butt (CB, a typical municipal solid waste), rather than the pure soluble organics (e.g., glycine, urea, citric acid, etc.), was used as the fuel. In this process, the cellulose acetate-based cigarette butt also acted as the support or template, because the manganese nitrate in the solution will be adsorbed and dispersed uniformly on the surface of the cellulose acetate fillers. After burning the impregnated cigarette butts, the nano-sized MnOx was obtained. Both smoldering and flaming combustion with different ignition temperatures were considered in the combustion synthesis process. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was conducted to study the combustion behavior of the pure and manganese nitrate-loaded cigarette butts. XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, XPS, H-2-TPR and N-2 adsorption-desorption were conducted to detect the physical and chemical characteristics. The product obtained via this combustion method was main in the Mn3O4 phase. The prepared nanoparticles with different ignition temperatures have a uniform particle size distribution (40-50 nm). The MnOx synthesized by smoldering showed better porosity than the flaming-combustion-synthesized MnOx. The H-2-TPR and XPS characterization showed that both of the catalysts synthesized by either the smoldering or flaming combustion process, possessed similar redox properties. The nano-MnOx catalyst was applied for the selective catalytic reduction of NO, and the results suggested that MnOx synthesized by smoldering had more stable activity.

In this study, microPCMs based on an n-octadecane (C18) core and a melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF) shell supplemented with O-2-plasma-modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were synthesized through in situ polymerization. Meanwhile, two different addition methods, the addition of modified CNTs into the emulsion system or into the polymer system, were compared and examined. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs showed that the microPCMs were spherical and had a broadened size distribution. Fourier transform infrared testing demonstrated that the modified CNTs did not affect C18 coated by MUF resin. The results indicate that the thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of the microPCMs were remarkably improved by the addition of a moderate amount of modified CNTs, but the heat enthalpy and encapsulated efficiency decreased slightly. Moreover, the thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of microPCMs modified with CNTs directly added to the polymer system were superior to those with CNTs added to emulsion system. In particular, when 0.2g of modified CNTs were added to the polymer system, the thermal conductivity of the microPCMs was improved by 225%, and the breakage rates of the microPCMs at 4000rpm for 5, 10, and 20min decreased by 74, 72, and 60%, respectively, compared with that of the microPCMs without modified CNTs.

The catalytic activity was further promoted by Ce-Zr oxides coatings. Oxides with different Ce/Zr ratios were synthesized via urea co-precipitation method and fully characterized. Catalytic performance of the monoliths was evaluated by oxygen-lean methane combustion through light-off experiments. Steep conversion curves were observed with oxygen completely depleted below 350 degrees C over all catalysts. Pd supported on ZrO2 ignited the reaction at the lowest temperature while similar activities for total oxygen conversion were observed for Zr-rich monoliths. Zr-embedded oxides promoted the activity on oxygen consumption due to the interaction between Zr and Pd at the interface, dispersing and stabilizing Pd particles on the catalyst surface. The addition of Ce further promoted the stability of the catalysts. Compared with Pd/Zr, Pd/Ce1Zr2 showed little deactivation after three successive light-offs and maintained stability after 500 h time-on-stream test. Core/shell Pd particles model was proposed for the activity. Small Pd metal particles on the surface serve as an activation site for methane whereas wrapped PdO in the core stabilized by the Ce-Zr oxides acts as oxygen donor. The extent of reduction of Pd has significant effect on activity in the reaction conditions. Other impacting factors such as different oxygen concentrations and space velocities were also assessed to investigate the extent of the influence on methane catalytic combustion.					li, chuang/HNT-0863-2023; Tsang, Chi-Wing/P-6554-2015	li, chuang/0000-0003-1890-2064; Tsang, Chi-Wing/0000-0001-9097-0948													2046-2069						2015	5	124					102147	102156		10.1039/c5ra13223a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra13223a													WOS:000366162300004

Such processes have been frequently investigated in sedimentary environments, but rarely referred to the agricultural fields, such as paddy soils with frequent occurrence of redox fluctuations. Our findings demonstrated that extensive center dot OH (40.3-1061.4 mu mol kg-1) was produced during oxygenation of anoxic paddy slurries under circumstance conditions. Wet chemical sequential extractions, Mo center dot ssbauer spectra, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations collectively corroborated that 0.5 M HCl-extracted Fe(II) (i.e., surface-bound Fe and Fe in low-crystalline minerals) contributed to more center dot OH production than aqueous Fe2+. The produced center dot OH can efficiently induce the oxidative transformation of organic carbon and the degradation of imidacloprid (IMP), which in turn produced the by-products, such as IMP-urea, IMP-olefin, and 6-chloronicontinic acid, via center dot OHattacking mechanisms. Quenching experiments showed that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was the important intermediate for center dot OH formation via Haber-Weiss mechanisms during oxygenation processes. These findings indicate that abundant center dot OH can be produced during the redox fluctuations of paddy soil, which might be of great significance to predict the removal of organic contaminants and the mineralization of organic carbon in paddy fields.

In this study, a novel copper-based adsorbent (UG@Cu-X) was prepared by direct calcination of a mixture of copper nitrate, urea, and glucose for PH3 purification under low-temperature and anaerobic conditions. As expected, this adsorbent prepared by a simple strategy showed excellent activity in capturing PH3, and the optimized adsorbent (UG@Cu-2) had a PH3 breakthrough capacity of up to 318.58 mg(PH3)center dot g(adsorbent)(-1) under harsh test conditions (anaerobic, temperature: 60 degrees C, PH3 concentration: 1,000 ppm, WHSV: 30,000 h(-1)). This value is significantly better than previously reported. Further studies demonstrated that the superior performance of UG@Cu-X was attributed to its relatively large specific surface area, unique microscopic morphology, high concentration of surface active oxygen, and more substantial alkalinity, while the main cause of adsorbent deactivation was the consumption of the active component CuO. Surprisingly, the deactivation of the UG@Cu-X resulted in the conversion of the active component (CuO) into the high value-added P-type semiconductor Cu3P, a huge po-tential utilization value in photocatalysis, energy storage, medicine, etc. This phenomenon indicates that the adsorbent prepared in this study can probably achieve resourceful conversion of PH3 while removing PH3 efficiently, and can probably avoid the risk of secondary pollution caused by the deactivated adsorbents.

Degradation is one of the ways to achieve the high-value conversion of lignin, among which the heating degradation of lignin by deep eutectic solvent (DES) can be an excellent green degradation method. In this study, choline chloride (CC) was used as the hydrogen bond acceptor, and urea (UR), ethylene glycol (GC), glycerol (GE), acetic acid (AA), formic and acetic mixed acid (MA), oxalic acid (OX), and p-toluenesulfonic acid (TA) were used as hydrogen bond donors to degrade lignin. NMR hydrogen spectroscopy was used for the simple and rapid determination of phenolic hydroxyl groups in lignin. FT-IR spectroscopy was used to characterize the changes of functional groups of lignin during DES treatment. GPC observed the molecular weight of lignin after degradation and found a significant increase in the homogeneity (1.6-2.0) and a significant decrease in the molecular weight M-w (2478-4330) of the regenerated lignin. It was found that acidic DES was more effective in depolymerizing alkaline lignin, especially for the toluene-choline chloride. Seven DES solutions were recovered, and it was found that the recovery of DES still reached more than 80% at the first recovery.

Then, various of techniques were implemented to analyze the structure of these as-prepared Al2O3 aerogels. The results showed that the Al2O3-Th possessed the uniform porous morphology, which might provide the large specific surface area and a large number of active sites to dislodge U(VI) species. Additionally, the adsorption properties of the as-prepared Al2O3 aerogels to U(VI) from solution were investigated. It could be concluded that the removal of U(VI) on Al2O3 aerogels were independent on ionic strength and strongly reliant on the initial pH. The adsorption isotherms of Al2O3-Th to U(VI) could be imitated using the Langmuir model and the maximum adsorption capacities in simulated seawater and aqueous solution were 270.9 and 634.0 mg/g, respectively, which showed that the adsorption property of Al2O3-Th was much better than that of other reported Al2O3-based adsorbents. In addition, the adsorption efficiency of Al2O3-Th reached 70% within 5 min and the equilibrium of U(VI) adsorption was achieved within 100 min (C0 = 10 mg/L). Meanwhile, the adsorption efficiency of Al2O3-Th to U (VI) maintained quite good and the value still reached about 93% after five consecutive cycles. These results indicated that the Al2O3 aerogels would be applied as potential materials for wastewater treatment.

The novelty of this research is that N-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQ) were prepared by microwave irradiation Glycerol-Urea-Citric acid mixture, in which Glycerol could expand the sp(2) domain of the NGQ. The effect of NGQ dosage on crystalline phases and porous properties of NGQ/FeBDC were thoroughly studied using X-ray Diffraction, Fourier-transform Infrared spectroscopy, and Nitrogen adsorption isotherm measurement. The optimal catalyst was 4-NGQ/FeBDC, with the doping percentage of NGQ in NGQ/FeBDC composite being at 4%wt. of the precursors. Some of the noticeable improvements of the 4-NGQ/FeBDC over the original FeBDC sample included a larger BET surface area (141.8 m(2) g(-1)), wider optical absorption edge, a smaller bandgap energy (2.42 eV), and faster degradation reaction. The optimal sample was able to completely decompose MB within 50 minutes and could be repeatedly exploited 4 times. The morphology of 4-NGQ/FeBDC particles was polyhedron shape with NGQ covering around, confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images. Some parameters that affect MB degradation of the 4-NGQ/FeBDC would be investigated, covering light irradiation, H2O2 presence, initial pH of MB solution, and reusability. The regeneration procedure of the optimal photocatalysts as well as the electron transfer mechanism within the photocatalytic system would be proposed in this paper.

Synthesis of carbon xerogels and their application in adsorption studies of caffeine and diclofenac as emerging contaminants	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH & DESIGN												This work involves the application of carbon xerogels in the removal of two emerging contaminants, caffeine and diclofenac, from aqueous solutions. Textural characterization of the carbon xerogels prepared by polycondensation of resorcinol with formaldehyde (with a molar ratio of 1:2) has been investigated using N-2 adsorption-desorption at -196 degrees C. Chemical surface groups were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy, elemental microanalysis and determination of isoelectric point. The equilibrium tests were carried out using different weights of adsorbent and the experimental data were best correlated by Sips isotherm equation. The kinetic experimental data were described using pseudo-first and pseudo-second order kinetic models, being well described by a pseudo-second order model. The maximum adsorption capacity was observed for adsorption of caffeine onto a xerogel treated with urea solution (182.5 mg g(-1)), due to the presence of Lewis bases on its surface, which increase the adsorption affinity for organic compounds. On the other hand, the higher extent of diclofenac adsorption was obtained with a carbon xerogel treated with sulfuric acid (80.0 mg g(-1)), mainly due to electronic interactions. Comparing these results with other data reported in the literature, the carbon xerogels employed in our study were found to exhibit comparable adsorption capacities and higher kinetic properties.

Fe complexes were homogeneously deposited (HD) on graphene oxide through in situ hydrolysis of urea, followed by two-step pyrolysis under Ar and NH3 atmospheres, resulting in formation of Fe- and N-fiinctionalized graphene (HD-FeN/G). The morphology, crystalline structure and elemental composition of HD-FeN/G were characterized. ORR activity was evaluated by using a rotary disk electrode (RDE) electrochemical system. HD improved the loading and distribution of the Fe-Nx composites on graphene. The ORR activity of the as-prepared HD-FeN/G in neutral medium was comparable to that of the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C and significantly superior to a FeN/G counterpart produced via traditional approach. The ORR electron transfer number of HD-FeN/G was as high as 3.83 +/- 0.08, which suggested that ORR catalysis proceeds through a four-electron pathway. HD-FeN/G was used as a cathodic electrocatalyst in microbial fuel cells (MFCs), and the resultant HD-FeN/G-MFC showed comparable voltage output and maximum power density to those of Pt/C-MFC. The HD-FeN/G-MFC achieved a maximum power density of 885 mW m(-2), which was much higher than that of FeN/G-MFC (708 mW m(-2)).

Their structural as well as textural properties can be easily tuned depending on the synthesis protocol utilized. Combustion synthesis has received increased attention as a one-pot route for the synthesis of a wide spectrum of nanomaterials. In this study, we present the results of synthesizing Ag NPs employing urea as a combustion fuel. The effect of the temperature of calcination on the formation and structural features of Ag NPs has been checked over the 400-700 degrees C temperature range. The characterization of the synthesized Ag NPs has been performed using XRD, SEM, TEM, and XPS techniques. It was found that Ag NPs, with a crystallite size of 40 nm, start to form at around 400 degrees C. Conducting the calcination at the 500-700 degrees C range results in the persistence of the obtained Ag NPs. Moreover, the obtained nanomaterials are characterized by a membrane-like morphology. The activity performance of the synthesized Ag NPs was examined for the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) over a temperature range of 35-50 degrees C. Increasing the calcination temperature has led to a decrease in the activity of the Ag NPs during the NaBH4 hydrolysis.

Their cost represents a considerable challenge to their widespread commercialization because of their sensitivity and the expensive cost of the employed platinum electrocatalysts. Accordingly, one feature of a fuel cell device that many interested parties are looking for is the engineering of catalysts with a low Pt content. Herewith, Pt supported on nickel loaded nitrogen-doped graphene (Pt@Ni,N-G) was synthesized through a simple pyrolysis process of mineral water bottles waste with urea and nickel metal at 800 degrees C followed by loading Pt in different proportions via a simple reduction method in aqueous solution at room temperature. The physicochemical and electrochemical properties of a promising Pt@Ni,N-G cathode electrocatalyst for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) were characterized and evaluated using a number of specialized techniques. The results showed that the high Pt@Ni,N-G content enhanced the catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with a specific activity of 3.13 mA cm(-2) and a mass activity of 12.35 mA mu g(Pt)(-1) at -0.1 V. A maximum power density of 87.8 mW cm(-2) was achieved which is closest to that of commercial Pt/C. Designing Pt@Ni,N-G electrocatalysts by recycling waste bottles is not only expected to reduce the cost of fuel cells by similar to 30 % to raise the industry standard but also protect the environment and humanity from harmful pollutants.

Natural polyacetylene glycosides (PGAs) had shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but their effects on kidney injury have not been evaluated. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of PGA on ischemic kidney injury in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and mice. Main methods: Hypoxic HK-2 cells and renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) mice were treated with PGA from Coreopsis tinctoria, and the cell viability, renal function, apoptosis, inflammation, mitochondrial injury, lipids metabolism were analyzed. Key findings: In vitro results showed that PGA improved cell viability and reduced oxidative stress, pro-apoptotic/pro-inflammatory factors expression and NF kappa B activation in TECs under hypoxia/reperfusion (H/R). Moreover, PGA reduced mitochondria oxidative stress and improved ATP production, Delta Psi m and mitochondria biogenesis, and inhibited lipids uptake, biosynthesis and accumulation in hypoxic TECs. In vivo, PGA significantly attenuated kidney injury and reduced blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (CREA) and urinary albumin (Alb), and increased creatinine clearance (CC) in IRI mice. PGA also decreased cell apoptosis, mitochondria oxidative stress, inflammatory response and lipid droplets accumulation, and promoted ATP generation in kidney of IRI mice. Significance: Our results proved that PGA ameliorated ischemic kidney injury via synergic anti-inflammation, mitochondria protection and anti-lipotoxicity actions, and it might be a promising multi-target therapy for ischemic AKI.

Synthesis and characterization of fluorinated anatase nanoparticles and subsequent N-doping for efficient visible light activated photocatalysis	COLLOIDS AND SURFACES B-BIOINTERFACES												Fluorinated-titanium dioxide (TiO2-F) nanoparticles in a pure anatase polymorph was precipitated from solution by hydrolysis of titanium oxychloride, using urea and ammonia as precipitation agents and potassium fluoride as a source of fluorine anion. A further wet attrition milling in presence of glycine completed by a heat treatment allowed an additional nitrogen doping of TiO2 (TiO2-F&N-HT). The morphology and crystalline structure of the as-synthesized powder was determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and showed that TiO2 powder was composed of nanoparticles with narrow size distribution which crystallized in the anatase phase. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that fluorine and nitrogen are present in TiO2 as surface fluorination and interstitial doping, respectively. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) showed an increased optical absorption in the visible for TiO2-F&N-HT sample. Under visible light irradiation, TiO2-F nanoparticles showed a high photocatalytic performance, showing the high potential of an improved surface fluorination for Escherichia coli (E, coli) disinfection in suspension. These results show the importance of anatase-TiO2 nanoparticles synthesis and modification by using a wet chemical approach leading to low aggregation and high specific surface area for effective bacterial inactivation. The co-doped TiO2-F&N-HT powder showed slightly improved performance compared to the fluorinated sample. The significant degree of aggregation after the heat treatment is postulated as being a limiting factor in its photocatalytic activity.

Green synthesis of Opuntia-derived carbon nanodots for the catalytic decolourization of cationic dyes	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												The continued discharge of synthetic dyes into aqueous ecosystems from industrial effluent sources represents a critical issue for both human and environmental health. Although there exist various treatments for the treatment of dye-containing wastewater, a low-cost, green, effective, and ecofriendly approach still remains to be developed. In this work, carbon nanodots were synthesised using prickly pear and urea as green precursors and tested as catalysts in the Fenton-like reaction for the catalytic decolourization of cationic dyes. Approximately 90% of a mix of three common cationic dyes (crystal violet, basic fuchsin and methyl green) at 5 x 10(-5) M were removed from water at 20 degrees C and pH 7.5 in the presence of H2O2 at 0.5% after only 60 minutes. The carbon nanodots utilised in this study were characterized by FTIR, XPS, zeta potential, UV-Vis and TEM. They exhibited negative surface charge, excellent aqueous solubility, and nitrogen rich surface functionalities which were involved in the transference of electrons, participating in the decomposition of H2O2, and therefore generated hydroxyls, superoxide ions and singlet oxygens as detected using the free radical quenching technique. This work provides an insight into exploiting an ecofriendly non-toxic metal-free catalyst using a low cost and efficient approach that showed promising decolourization results, without the use of external energy, at a neutral pH solution that could be potentially applied in catalysis of a range of environmental pollutants.					cole, ivan/C-6395-2008; Truskewycz, Adam/CAH-0873-2022	Anderson Beker, Sabrina/0000-0001-8527-0760; Truskewycz, Adam/0000-0003-1454-962X; Ball, Andrew/0000-0003-2387-968X; Cole, Ivan/0000-0001-6582-1457													1144-0546	1369-9261				DEC 14	2020	44	46					20001	20012		10.1039/d0nj03013a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0nj03013a													WOS:000597581100005

In this contribution, a robust CuMg oxide was prepared as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for both H-2 production by MeOH reforming and hydrogenation of methyl levulinate (ML) to GVL in MeOH medium. RESULTS Cu0.87Mg0.13Ox prepared by a urea hydrolysis method offered a GVL yield up to 90.6% at 220 degrees C in 4 h without external hydrogen. This catalyst could be reused for at least seven consecutive cycles without loss of its activity. Notably, Cu0.87Mg0.13Ox also provided nearly 70% GVL yield in methanolysis products of cellulose in the presence of humins. Characterization of the catalyst indicates that the incorporation of MgO greatly facilitates the stabilization of Cu+ species that possess a better catalytic performance in ML hydrogenation compared with metallic Cu. CONCLUSION This robust Cu0.87Mg0.13Ox could greatly contribute to develop a highly facile and desirable two-step strategy for GVL production from cellulose, through the integration of ML production by methanolysis of cellulose, H-2 formation by MeOH reforming and ML hydrogenation in MeOH medium.

The effect on the catalytic activity and the physicochemical properties of IrRu/Al2O3 catalysts caused by introducing Ru onto Ir with different amounts is investigated. Bimetallic IrRu catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation of iridium and ruthenium onto the alumina support, where the total amount of iridium and ruthenium combined was kept constant. IrRu bimetallic catalysts were analyzed using various characterization methods such as XRD, H-2-TPR, CO chemisorption, H-2-TPD, TEM, EDX-mapping, and XPS analyses. Activity results indicate that IrRu bimetallic catalysts led to a drastic enhancement of de-NOx activity in the low-temperature region, while monometallic Ir and Ru catalysts exhibited diminished or even zero activity toward NOx reduction. Detailed examination of XRD patterns and SEM/EDX mapping analyses implied the formation of an IrRu alloy after reduction. Hence, the synergetic effect between Ir and Ru is expected to originate from the intrinsic characteristics of the IrRu alloy phase rather than Ir and Ru acting separately as independent dual active sites. The utilization of bimetallic IrRu catalysts in NOx reduction using CO as a reductant under lean conditions is expected to enable the reduction of NOx with high efficiency at low temperatures without the need of using urea-based reductants even under oxidative conditions.

Iron oxide doping not only introduced magnetism into the biochar for easy separation, but also influenced its catalytic ability for PS activation. In the Fe-N-BC/PS system, almost all acid orange (AO7) was removed within 90 min with an apparent rate constant (k(obs)) of 0.114 min(-1), which was almost 37 times larger than that of pure N-BC (0.003 min(-1)). Factors influencing the removal of AO7 were investigated, including PS concentration, catalyst dosage, and initial pH. The Fe-N-BC/PS system had high removal efficiencies for various organic contaminants and showed high resistance to inorganic anions in aquatic environments. The radical quenching studies, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements, and electrochemical analyses verified that the mechanism of AO7 degradation in the Fe-N-BC/PS system included both radical and non-radical pathways involving the generation of (OH)-O-center dot, SO4-center dot, O-2(-center dot), O-1(2), and electron transfer. Additionally, persistent free radicals (PERs) on the catalysts also related to their catalytic efficiencies. These results demonstrated that the Fe-N-BC/PS system had the potential for wastewater treatment applications.

M.; Pei, York			Salsalate, but not metformin or canagliflozin, slows kidney cyst growth in an adult-onset mouse model of polycystic kidney disease	EBIOMEDICINE												Background: Multiple preclinical studies have highlighted AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a potential therapeutic target for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Both metformin and canagliflozin indirectly activate AMPK by inhibiting mitochondrial function, while salsalate is a direct AMPK activator. Metformin, canagliflozin and salsalate (a prodrug dimer of salicylate) are approved for clinical use with excellent safety profile. Although metformin treatment had been shown to attenuate experimental cystic kidney disease, there are concerns that therapeutic AMPK activation in human kidney might require a higher oral metformin dose than can be achieved clinically. Methods: In this study, we tested metformin-based combination therapies for their additive (metformin plus canagliflozin) and synergistic (metformin plus salsalate) effects and each drug individually in an adult-onset conditional Pkd1 knock-out mouse model (n = 20 male/group) using dosages expected to yield clinically relevant drug levels. Findings: Compared to untreated mutant mice, treatment with salsalate or metformin plus salsalate improved kidney survival (i.e. blood urea nitrogen <20 mmol/L at the time of sacrifice) and reduced cystic kidney disease severity. However, the effects of metformin plus salsalate did not differ from salsalate alone; and neither metformin nor canagliflozin was effective. Protein expression and phosphorylation analyses indicated that salsalate treatment was associated with reduction in mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) activity and cellular proliferation in Pkd1 mutant mouse kidneys. Global gene expression analyses suggested that these effects were linked to restoration of mitochondrial function and suppression of inflammation and fibrosis. Interpretation: Salsalate is a highly promising candidate for drug repurposing and clinical testing in ADPKD. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In cancer cells, the high glycolytic flux induces carbonyl stress, a damaging condition in which the increase of reactive carbonyl species makes DNA, proteins, and lipids more susceptible to glycation. Together with glucose, methylglyoxal (MGO), a byproduct of glycolysis, is considered the main glycating agent. MGO is highly diffusible, enters the nucleus, and can react with easily accessible lysine- and arginine-rich tails of histones. Glycation adducts on histones undergo oxidization and further rearrange to form stable species known as advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). This modification alters nucleosomes stability and chromatin architecture deconstructing the histone code. Formation of AGEs has been associated with cancer, diabetes, and several age-related diseases. Recently, DJ-1, a cancer-associated protein that protects cells from oxidative stress, has been described as a deglycase enzyme. Although its role in cell survival results still controversial, in several human tumors, its expression, localization, oxidation, and phosphorylation were found altered. This work aimed to explore the molecular mechanism that triggers the peculiar cellular compartmentalization and the specific post-translational modifications (PTM) that, occurring in breast cancer cells, influences the DJ-1 dual role. Using a proteomic approach, we identified on DJ-1 a novel threonine phosphorylation (T125) that was found, by the in-silico tool scansite 4, as part of a putative Akt consensus. Notably, this threonine is in addition to histidine 126, a key residue involved in the formation of catalytic triade (glu18-Cys106-His126) inside the glioxalase active site of DJ. Interestingly, we found that pharmacological modulation of Akt pathway induces a functional tuning of DJ-1 proteoforms, as well as their shuttle from cytosol to nucleus, pointing out that pathway as critical in the development of DJ-1 pro-tumorigenic abilities. Deglycase activity of DJ-1 on histones proteins, investigated by coupling 2D tau gel with LC-MS/MS and 2D-TAU (Triton-Acid-Urea)-Western blot, was found correlated with its phosphorylation status that, in turn, depends from Akt activation. In normal conditions, DJ-1 acts as a redox-sensitive chaperone and as an oxidative stress sensor. In cancer cells, glycolytic rewiring, inducing increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, enhances AGEs products. Alongside, the moderate increase of ROS enhances Akt signaling that induces DJ-1-phosphorylation. When phosphorylated DJ-1 increases its glyoxalase activity, the level of AGEs on histones decreases. Therefore, phospho-DJ-1 prevents glycation-induced histones misregulation and its Akt-related hyperactivity represents a way to preserve the epigenome landscape sustaining proliferation of cancer cells. Together, these results shed light on an interesting mechanism that cancer cells might execute to escape the metabolic induced epigenetic misregulation that otherwise could impair their malignant proliferative potential.

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) may provide sensitive, fast, and clinical-grade real-time monitoring of these toxins, enabling effective management with timely dialysis treatments. This study introduces a 3D-printed microchamber that integrates the fabrication of plasmonic metal nanoparticles for the in-flow detection of biological toxins and pharmaceutical drugs using SERS, making it ideal for on-site diagnostics in clinical settings. The microchamber supports quantitative and highly reproducible detection with liquid volumes under 100 mu L, which is crucial for trace-level biomarker detection and minimizing cross-contamination. It employs a tunable solvent exchange method for the in situ synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on flexible PDMS or rigid Si wafer substrates, avoiding costly nanofabrication techniques. Ultralow detection limits were achieved for two model compounds and three pharmaceutical drugs: 10-11 M for rhodamine 6G, 10-7 M for adenine, and 10-6 M for the pharmaceutical drugs. A total of 13 biological toxins, including three neurotransmitters, one neuromodulator, five amino acids, two polyamines, and two urea cycle metabolites, were detected with quantitative limits ranging from 10-3 to 10-6 M, all below permissible levels and aligning with physiological conditions. SERS detection within microchambers facilitates rapid on-site analysis, proving ideal for personalized health monitoring, point-of-care diagnostics, and environmental pollution assessment.

Key to their synthesis is the versatile tool ammonia, either as a gas or as a liquid. For metallic nitrides MxFe4-xN including transition-metal and main-group elements M, it is of paramount importance to follow an improved ammonolytic reaction for achieving both stable and metastable compounds; in addition, there is a magnetic effect acting on the crystal structure of GaxFe4-xN, and one also finds spin-glass behavior in main-group nitrides (M = Ga, Ge, Sn). The guanidinate review features an oxidation-controlled low-temperature synthesis of Yb salts, the first magnetic guanidinates, and the doubly-deprotonated guanidinates; the latter represent the all nitrogen analogues of the ubiquitous carbonates. The covered guanidinates adopt the compositions MCN3H4, M(CN3H4)(2), M(CN3H4)(3) and MC(NH)(3) (M = Li Cs, Sr, Eu, Yb). We also cover the application of first-principles calculations at all levels to gain a deeper understanding of the studied materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to disclose it, three kinds of CeO2 supports with three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous structure (3DOM), nanotubes (NT) and nanocubes (NC) were synthesized by nanocasting of a mesoporous silica KIT-6 template with cubic Ia3d symmetries, hydrothermal method with and without urea, respectively. Various characterization methods (XRD, BET, H-2-TPR, CO-TPD, TEM and XPS) were used to characterize the structure-reactivity relationship of catalysts. The Co/CeO2-3DOM catalyst had higher H-2 producing rate (4.2 mmol/min.g(cat)) than Co/CeO2-NC (3.5 mmol/min . g(cat)) and Co/CeO2-NT (3.2 mmol/min.g(cat)) under the reaction conditions of 500 degrees C and GHSV = 6000 mL/g(cat).h. The Co/CeO2-3DOM catalysts presented Co nanoparticles with mean size of 5.2 nm, and the highest surface Co concentration (5.12%) and Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio (0.53). Its high activity is attributed to higher surface area and more surface oxygen vacancies. The specific surface area and surface oxygen vacancy are significantly affected by the morphology of CeO2 support. The more mechanism insight of the structure-activity relationship for ammonia decomposition has been revealed.					haung, chuanqing/JFK-2376-2023; Liu, Zeyu/ABE-8588-2020	Liu, Zeyu/0000-0001-9475-1582													0169-4332	1873-5584				DEC 1	2020	532								147335	10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147335													WOS:000573284000010

Ameliorative Effect of Vitamin E on Biochemical and Ultrastructural Changes in Artemether-induced Renal Toxicity in Rats	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY												This experiment was designed to study the administration of normal doses of one of recent antimalarial drug and coadministration of vitamin E on the kidney tissue. A total twenty-four adult male albino rats were used and divided into four groups: the first one served as a control, the second received artemether orally for three days consecutively. The rats of the third and fourth groups received the same dose of artemether concomitantly with 50 and 100 mg/kg vitamin E orally daily for 2 weeks. After the last dose, the rats were sacrificed and the kidney tissues with blood samples obtained and processed for light, electron microscopic and biochemical analysis. Histologically, artemether treated kidneys showed atrophied glomeruli with widened urinary space and kidney tubules were degenerated with disturbed contour and some vacuoles inside it. Ultrastructurally, the glomeruli of this group showed hypertrophic endothelial cells, irregularity of its basement membrane, disrupted foot processes and filtration slits. The kidney tubule cells showed loss of basal infoldings, cytoplasmic vacuolation, polymorphic damaged swollen mitochondria a loss of its microvilli towards its capillary lumen. Artemether plus vitamin E of the rat kidney groups showed improvement of morphological changes compared to the changes seen in artemether alone. These data were confirmed by biochemical findings with marked improvement of blood urea and creatinine levels and increase of anti-oxidant enzyme activities of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in the vitamin E treated groups. The results of this study revealed that vitamins E can improve the adverse changes of artemether of rat renal tissue.

Which type of N atom is the key factor for activation is still unclear and needs to be further explored and analyzed. In this study, four kinds of biochar were prepared using urea and rice husk as precursors, and tested for the catalytic degradation of dimethomorph. Increasing the nitrogen doping level caused the catalytic removal efficiency of dimethomorph in the presence of peroxymonosulfate increased from 16.6% to 86.8%. A correlation analysis showed that the ability of N-doped biochar to activate PMS is mainly related to the content of pyrrole N, graphite N and carbonyl and the degree of defects. In experiments on electron paramagnetic resonance and free radical suppression, the reactive species of SO4 center dot-, O-1(2),center dot OH and O-2(center dot-) were detected, among which O-1(2) was found to be the main agent in the nonradical pathway. The degradation pathways for dimethomorph were analyzed based on a total of 8 degradation products identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-Q-TOFMS). The results of this study provide a fundamental basis for using agricultural waste to produce inexpensive and efficient nonmetal catalysts that are highly effective in reducing dimethomorph levels in agricultural lands.

It is clearly demonstrated that the as-prepared amount-optimized nanocomposite exhibits exceptional visible-light photocatalytic activities for CO2 conversion to CH4 and for H-2 evolution, respectively by approximate to 28-time (140 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and approximate to 31-time (313 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) enhancement compared to the widely accepted outstanding g-C3N4 prepared with urea as the raw material, along with the calculated quantum efficiencies of approximate to 4.92% and 2.78% at 420 nm wavelength. It is confirmed mainly based on the steady-state surface photovoltage spectra, transient-state surface photovoltage responses, fluorescence spectra related to the produced center dot OH amount, and electrochemical reduction curves that the exceptional photoactivities are comprehensively attributed to the large surface area (85.5 m(2) g(-1)) due to the porous structure, to the greatly enhanced charge separation and to the introduced catalytic functions to the carrier-related redox reactions by decorating MnOx and coupling Au center dot TiO2, respectively, to modulate holes and electrons. Moreover, it is suggested mainly based on the photocatalytic experiments of CO2 reduction with isotope (CO2)-C-13 and D2O that the produced center dot CO2 and center dot H as active radicals would be dominant to initiate the conversion of CO2 to CH4.

Efficient DBT removal from diesel oil by CVD synthesized N-doped graphene as a nanoadsorbent: Equilibrium, kinetic and DFT study	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Adsorptive Dibenzothiophene (DBT) removal from diesel oil stream on nitrogen doped graphene (N-doped graphene) was considered. The N-doped graphene was synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method at 1000 degrees C using camphor and urea. The adsorbent was characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Nitrogen adsorption/desorption technique. Adsorption parameters such as temperature, time, concentration and mass loaded were optimized by experimental design method. Experimental kinetic data was fitted to Pseudo second order model successfully. Frendulich model was recommended for experimental isotherm data. However, Tempkin model was presented because of the importance of interaction between pyridinic nitrogen and DBT aromatic structure. The results indicate that not only the pore volume and surface area but also types of surface functionalities have an important role for DBT adsorption process, especially for the adsorbates with aromatic structures. The adsorption capacity was calculated up to 73.4 mg/g which is 1.25 times higher than the adsorption capacity of pristine. Thermal regeneration stability, fast adsorption kinetics and high adsorption capacity make N-G4 a potential promising adsorbent for DBT removal. Besides, density functional theory calculations revealed that an increase in the number of doped N atoms as well as the presence of a mono or divacancy defect in N-doped graphene can enhance the adsorption energy of DBT.

In this study, a novel disposable L-cysteine (CySH) sensor was developed based on screen-printed gold electrode (SPAuE) electrodeposited with copper. The constant potential electrodeposition was carried out at -0.4 V (versus an Ag pseudo-reference) for 480 s. The morphology and the crystal structure of electrodeposited copper were examined by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The analytical utility of the copper-modified SPAuE (Cu/SPAuE) was evaluated in an alkaline medium for the electrooxidation of CySH using cyclic voltammetry and amperometry techniques. The Cu/SPAuE exhibited fast response time (<5 s) and two linear ranges from 1 to 400 mu M (sensitivity of 0.028 mu A mu M-1) and 400-1800 mu M (sensitivity of 0.014 mu A mu M-1) with a detection limit (S/N = 3) of 0.21 mu M. The proposed CySH sensor also demonstrated high specificity in the presence of common interfering electroactive substances, such as sucrose, glucose, citric acid, urea, EDTA, oxalic acid, and uric acid. Furthermore, the proposed method has been successfully applied to the determination of CySH in human and rabbit blood serums without any sample pretreatment whereas the analytical recoveries were reasonably good, varying between 97.40 and 108.56% with satisfactory precision (RSD < 9%).

A carbon paste electrode modified with 6.0% (m/m) decanoic acid and TBAB-based HDES was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The oxidation peak currents of the proposed electrode were enhanced by its high electrochemical activity, fast electron transfer rate, and high surface area, while a remarkable decrease was observed in the peak potential separation. The electrochemical determination of hydroquinone (H(2)Q) was carried out using square-wave adsorptive anodic stripping voltammetry (SWAdASV). The electrode response was found to be linear in the H(2)Q concentration range of 2.5 x 10(-6)-3.0 x 10(-3) mol L-1, with the limit of detection (LOD) of 7.7 x 10(-7) mol L-1.

Dietary CP and digestion kinetics influence BW loss, litter weight gain, and reproduction by affecting postprandial amino acid metabolism in lactating sows	ANIMAL												To avoid a high body protein mobilization in modern lean sows during lactation, an adequate dietary amino acid (AA) supply and an efficient AA utilization are crucial. This study evaluated the effects of dietary CP and in vitro protein digestion kinetics on changes in sow body condition, litter weight gain, milk composition, blood metabolites, protein utilization efficiency and subsequent reproductive performance. We hypothesized that a slower digestion of dietary protein would improve AA availability and utilization. In total, 110 multiparous sows were fed one of four lactation diets ina 2 x 2 factorial design, with two CP concentrations: 140 g/kg vs 180 g/kg, and two protein digestion kinetics, expressed as a percentage of slow protein ( in vitro degradation between 30 and 240 min): 8 vs 16% of total protein. Feeding sows the high CP diets reduced sow weight loss (A = 7.6 kg, P < 0.01), estimated body fat loss (A = 2.6 kg, P = 0.02), and estimated body protein loss (A = 1.0 kg, P = 0.08), but only at a high percentage of slow protein. A higher percentage of slow protein increased litter weight gain throughout lactation (A = 2.6 kg, P = 0.04) regardless of CP concentrations, whereas a higher CP only increased litter weight gain during week 3 of lactation (A = 1.2 kg, P = 0.01). On Day 15 postfarrowing, serial blood samples were taken from a subsample of sows fed with the high CP diets. In these sows, a high percentage of slow protein resulted in higher plasma AA concentrations at 150 and 180 min after feeding (A = 0.89, P = 0.02, A = 0.78, P = 0.03, mmol/L, respectively) and lower increases in urea at 90 and 120 min after feeding (A = 0.67, P = 0.04, A = 0.70, P = 0.03, mmol/L, respectively). The higher dietary CP concentration increased total nitrogen loss to the environment (A = 604 g, P < 0.01) with a reduction of protein efficiency (A = 14.8%, P < 0.01). In the next farrowing, a higher percentage of slow protein increased subsequent liveborn litter size (A = 0.7, P < 0.05). In conclusion, feeding sows with a high dietary CP concentration alleviated maternal weight loss during lactation when the dietary protein digestion rate was slower, but lowered protein efficiency. A slower protein digestion improved litter weight gain, possibly by reducing AA oxidation and improving plasma AA availability, thus, improving protein efficiency. (c) 2024 The Authors.

We compared the effects of six agricultural practices on nitrifier activity, abundance and diversity at nine sites in central Ivory Coast. Treatments, including repeated fertilization with ammonium and urea, had no effect on nitrification and crop N status after 3 to 5 crop cycles. Nitrification was actually higher at low than medium ammonium level. The nitrifying community was always dominated by ammonia oxidizing archaea and Nitrospira. However, the abundances of ammonia oxidizing bacteria, AOB, and Nitrobacter increased with fertilization after 5 crop cycles. Several AOB populations, some affiliated to Nitrosospira strains with urease activity or adapted to fluctuating ammonium levels, emerged in fertilized plots, which was correlated to nitrifying community ability to benefit from fertilization. In these soils, dominant nitrifiers adapted to very low ammonium levels have to be replaced by high-N nitrifiers before fertilization can stimulate nitrification. Our results show that the delay required for this replacement is much longer than ever observed for other terrestrial ecosystems, i.e. >5 crop cycles, and demonstrate for the first time that nitrifier characteristics jeopardize the efficiency of fertilization in moist savanna soils.

In this study, porous CeO2 and Zr-doped CeO2 catalysts with high surface area have been prepared via a low temperature synthesis strategy and evaluated for the conversion of CO2 and methanol into dimethyl carbonate (DMC). Results show that the Zr doping (Zr:Ce = 1:9) could slightly increase the DMC formation rate of CeO2, whereas the H2 heat -treatment of CeO2 could lead to a DMC formation rate of 18.22 +/- 0.64 mmol g-1h- 1, which is amongst the highest for CeO2 catalysts at 140 degrees C reported so far. Such enhancement in DMC formation rate is attributed to (1) the balanced crystallinity and defects of the CeO2, (2) a shift of acid and base activity to lower temperature, and (3) the (1 1 1) plane only surface termination of the catalyst resulted from the heat -treatment process. Excluding the best performed H2 heat -treated CeO2 catalyst, the DMC formation rate of the rest catalysts shows a positive link to the BET surface area, acid property (NH3-TPD), OV%, Ce3+%, and the Raman peak intensity ratio of ID/IF2g of the catalyst. The low temperature preparation strategy in this study could be applicable to the synthesis of CeO2 catalyst towards other reactions (e.g., non -reductive CO2 conversions to various carbonates, carbamates, urea derivatives, etc.).

Dynamic biochar effects on soil nitrous oxide emissions and underlying microbial processes during the maize growing season	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Biochar application is a promising approach to decrease nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils, yet little is known about how biochar affects N2O-producing and consuming microbial processes under changing field conditions. We conducted a field study to assess if growing season patterns in soil N2O emissions were correlated with the underlying microbial processes of nitrification and denitrification. We measured soil N2O emissions, potential nitrification and denitrification rates, and the abundance of key soil nitrogen (N)-cycling functional genes in an intensive maize production field trial in Illinois, USA that included the following four treatments: Control (unamended), Biochar (100 Mg ha(-1)), Nitrogen (269 kg N ha(-1) as Urea Ammonium Nitrate fertilizer), and Biochar + Nitrogen (100 Mg ha(-1) and 269 kg N ha(-1), respectively). Biochar increased potential nitrification rates when soil ammonium concentrations were high following fertilizer application, thus enhancing N2O emissions in the Biochar + Nitrogen treatment early in the season which were likely nitrification associated. However, over the full growing season, biochar application reduced cumulative N2O emissions in Biochar + Nitrogen plots to levels similar to the unamended Control. This could be attributed to biochar suppression of potential denitrification throughout the growing season. The treatments amended with biochar avoided large pulses of N2O emissions following intense rain events in the mid-season, while also sustaining lower N2O emissions in the late-season. Our study demonstrates that biochar can have dynamic effects on soil N2O emissions and the underlying microbial processes that depend on changing edaphic conditions, such as soil inorganic nitrogen availability and moisture, over the growing season.

J	Racz, AS				Racz, Adel Sarolta			Atomistic insights into salicylic acid treatment on human keratinized skin by XPS combined with argon gas cluster sputtering: A pilot study	SURFACES AND INTERFACES												Stratum corneum is the skin's outermost layer, whose main constituent is keratin. The treatment of dermatological diseases showing hyperkeratosis is a serious problem in dermatology and cosmetics seriously affecting the population showing increasing prevalence. One of the treatment is a peeling agent like salicylic acid (SA), categorized as a keratolytic agent, however its mode of action is not fully understood. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a method for monitoring the changes of surface composition at atomistic level in 5-10 nm depth. The development of argon cluster sputtering enabled the investigation of deeper regions (nanometric level) even for biomaterials. In this pilot study, the mode of action of SA has been studied at atomistic level for the first time. Different concentrations of SA (3, 5, 10 wt%) in different time frames (1 day, 1 week, 1 month) was applied on human keratinized skin. The carbon, nitrogen and oxygen peak have not shown changes during the treatment, not showing the suggested desmolytic mechanism of SA. However, significant changes were observed in the sulfur peak, with increasing time and concentration the rate of sulfonate and sulfate was increased compared to thiol group indicating the break of sulfide bonds between the polypeptide chains in keratin, indicating that keratolysis happens at nanometric level. Already a 1 week-10 wt% SA treatment resulted in higher rate of sulfate compared to sulfonate indicating further oxidation of the keratolytic product. However, 1 month10 wt% treatment resulted in the same surface composition as 3 wt%-1-month treatment indicating that enough time with low concentration can exert the same effect as higher concentrations. These findings have relevance in the design of future SA-based dermatologic therapies.																			2468-0230					DEC	2024	55								105452	10.1016/j.surfin.2024.105452	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.surfin.2024.105452		NOV 2024											WOS:001407560200001

Fe(OH)(2)-Ni(OH)(2) and Fe(OH)(2)-Co(OH)(2) electrodes have been prepared through a urea-based chemical bath deposition (CBD) method that enables to control and optimize structure and loading. The effect of the spatial arrangement of the metals in the hydroxide deposits on the electrocatalytic activity in alkaline media has been evaluated. Ultrathin films formed by bilayers resulting from the deposition of submonolayer amounts of Ni or Co hydroxides on previously deposited Fe(OH)(2) layers were found to exhibit the best electrocatalytic behavior. The turnover frequency for O-2 generation increases drastically as the amount of either Ni or Co decreases, reaching maximum values 2.6 and 1.6 times higher than those for FTO/Ni(OH)(2) and FTO/Co(OH)(2) electrodes, respectively. This shows that the presence of underlying Fe(OH)(2) nanoparticles plays a crucial role in enhancing the electrocatalytic properties of Ni or Co sites. The fact that these ultrathin electrodes, formed by extremely small amounts of electrocatalysts, show good stability in alkaline media paves the way for their use as transparent electrodes or co-catalysts for water splitting photoanodes.

N,F-TiO2 and carbon are mixed up physically as hybrid support of Pt nanoparticles for methanol electrooxidation. TEM shows that the utilization of the hybrid support leads to the uniform distribution and small particles size of Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) in Pt-N,F-TiO2/C catalyst. COad stripping experiment results indicate that the addition of N,F-TiO2 facilitates the oxidative removal of CO on Pt surface. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetric and chronoamperometric experiments show that the prepared Pt-N,F-TiO2/C catalyst exhibits much better catalytic activity and stability compared to Pt-TiO2/C, Pt/C (JM) and Pt/C (hm) catalysts. For instance, the peak current and the stable current at 7200 s of the Pt-N,F-TiO2/C catalyst are about 1.85 and 2.66 times of the Pt/C (JM) catalyst. The catalytic performance of the Pt-N,F-TiO2/C is also evaluated in a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), which exhibits a maximum power density of 51.6 mW cm(-2), 1.65 times of an analogs fuel cell using Pt/C (JM) as an anode catalyst. Therefore, the N,F-TiO2 has great application prospect as a high-performance electrocatalyst support for methanol electrooxidation in DMFC.

This work aims at the rational development of a dedicated catalyst that is highly active and selective towards formic acid decomposition to carbon dioxide under SCR-relevant conditions, i.e. under lean conditions and in presence of a large amount of water. The incremental addition of a basic oxide (lanthana) to Au/TiO2 revealed an optimum in the base-induced promotional effect. The base-modification of Au/TiO2 induced a C-H bond weakening of the bidentate formates, which are the dominant surface species and the kinetically relevant intermediates for carbon dioxide formation. At 15 wt% lanthana loading, monodentate formates were substantially suppressed leading to similar to 85% reduction in carbon monoxide production. Very high lanthanum surface concentrations lowered the relative coverage of oxygen-derived surface species that are crucial for the decomposition of the abundantly present formates. The linearity of the Constable-Cremer relationship between the apparent activation energy and the natural log of the pre-exponential factor indicates the mechanistic similarity in formic acid decomposition on gold supported on unmodified and lanthanum-modified titania catalysts. Such mechanistic insights helped derive an optimal catalyst. The optimal catalyst exhibited close to three-fold higher activity for ammonium formate decomposition while still maintaining 100% selectivity to ammonia.

On reduction of the polymer film at -0.80V vs SCE, high concentrations of dopamine (DA) were incorporated and the DA was subsequently released at a potential of 0.10V vs SCE. Much higher levels of DA were incorporated and released at PPy-s-CD compared to polypyrrole films doped with smaller anions and doped with the larger para-toluene sulfonic acid. In addition to releasing higher concentrations of DA, the DA was less prone to oxidation and degradation in the presence of the sulfonated -cyclodextrin. This was attributed to the formation of an inclusion complex between the protonated DA molecule and the anionic CD. The higher release rates were explained in terms of the immobile nature of the large CD and the high charge density with approximately 9 sulfonated groups attached to the rim of the CD cavity, which facilitated the uptake of high levels of DA. Approximately 6.0molcm(-2) of DA was released at 0.10V vs SCE over 60min on reducing the PPy-s-CD film for 30min at -0.80V vs SCE. Higher levels of 9.6molcm(-2) were obtained on increasing the reduction period to 60min, while levels of 14.0molcm(-2) were achieved with thicker polymer films.

In this work, we designed a Fe2O3 nanoparticles decorated 2D N-doped porous graphene-like carbon material (Fe(1.0)-N/C-800) from the one-step pyrolysis of low-cost and abundant substrates (-cyclodextrin, urea and FeCl3) under N-2 atmosphere. The doped N can change the charge distribution of C atoms around N atoms and offer active N species such as pyridinic-N and graphitic-N to provide more ORR active sites. The appropriate Fe2O3 nanoparticles encapsulated in the graphene-like carbon layer can enhance the electron and O-2 transfer and boost the ORR process. Therefore, the synergetic effect of Fe2O3 nanoparticles modifying and N doping can greatly promote the ORR process. The study on the poisoning of Fe3+ by SCN- further reveals that the Fe2O3 nanoparticles wrapped in the carbon layer will coordinate with N to form Fe-N-x active sites, which can further enhance ORR activity. Thus, the obtained Fe(1.0)-N/C-800 electrocatalyst possesses excellent ORR catalytic performance in alkaline media (E-onset=0.937V, E-1/2=0.832V) as well as a superior methanol tolerance and long-term test stability both in alkaline and acidic media. This work leads a simple and cost-efficient way to fabricate high-performance ORR catalysts.					huaming, li/S-1885-2016; Xia, Jiexiang/J-4793-2013	Liu, Gaopeng/0000-0003-1657-3578													2365-6549					APR 16	2019	4	14					4131	4139		10.1002/slct.201900533	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/slct.201900533													WOS:000467344100021

Three representative paste electrodes, which differ by the weight ratio between Zn(II) metallomesogen and carbon nanotubes (CNT), i.e., PE_01, PE_02 and PE_03, were obtained by mixing the materials in different amounts. The composition with the largest amount of CNT with respect to Zn complex, i.e., PE_03, gives the best electrochemical signal for uric acid detection by cyclic voltammetry in an alkaline medium. The amphiphilic structure of the Zn(II) coordination complex likely induces a regular separation between the metal centers favoring the redox system through their reduction, followed by stripping, and is characterized by enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards uric acid oxidation. The comparative detection of uric acid between the PE_03 paste electrode and the commercial zinc electrode demonstrated the superiority of the former, and its great potential for the development of advanced electrochemical detection of uric acid. Advanced electrochemical techniques, such as differential-pulsed voltammetry (DPV) and square-wave voltammetry (SWV), allowed for the highly sensitive detection of uric acid in aqueous alkaline solutions. In addition, a good and fast amperometric signal for uric acid detection was achieved by multiple-pulsed amperometry, which was validated by urine analysis.

Then, the powders were immobilized on the glass spheres by sodium silicate to improve its recyclability. The structure and morphological properties also were characterized. A common antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) as water pollutant, was degraded to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of N-TiO2 immobilized on glass spheres. N-TiO2 sample with NM weight ratio of 0.34% exhibits highest visible photocatalytic activity and the removal rate of CIP reached 90% in 90 min under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic efficiency was hardly reduced after 5 cycle experiments, indicating that the recyclability of immobilized N-TiO2 was well. The kinetic model of degradation of CIP was confirmed as a first-order kinetic reaction model. The degradation products of CIP were analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF MS). A database containing 49 kinds of the degradation products of CIP already reported in the papers was established to screen the UPLC-Q-TOF MS results. 17 kinds of degradation products were found and the possible degradation pathways to CIP were inferred. The toxicological properties of these degradation products were assessed by computer software simulation. In this study, a new, simple and stable immobilization method was used to prepare N-TiO2 immobilized on glass spheres, and a rapid screening method for the degradation products of CIP was established.

Metabolomic analysis and a chemometric approach allow description of the metabolic profile of CDCS as compared to normal subjects. In the present work, UHPLC/MS was employed to analyze blood samples withdrawn from CDCS carriers (n =18) and normal parental subjects (n = 18), all aged 0-34 years, aiming to set up a representative CDCS profile constructed from 33 targeted amino acids and biogenic amines. Methionine sulfoxide (MetO) was of particular concern with respect to CDCS redox balance. Increased serotonin (3 fold), methionine sulfoxide (2-fold), and Asp levels, and a little lower Orn, citrulline, Leu, Val, Ile, Asn, Gln, Trp, Thr, His, Phe, Met, and creatinine levels were found in the plasma of CDCS patients. Nitrotyrosine and Trp did not differ in normal and CDCS individuals.The accumulated metabolites may reflect, respectively, disturbances in the redox balance, deficient purine biosynthesis, and altered behavior, whereas the amino acid abatement in the latter group may affect the homeostasis of the urea cycle, citric acid cycle, branched chain amino acid synthesis, Tyr and Trp metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis. The identification of enzymatic deficiencies leading to the amino acid burden in CDCS is further required for elucidating its molecular bases and eventually propose specific or mixed amino acid supplementation to newborn patients aiming to balance their metabolism.

Voltammetric Determination of 3-Methylmorphine Using Glassy Carbon Electrode Modified with rGO and Bismuth Film	BIOSENSORS-BASEL												This work reports the development and application of a simple, rapid and low-cost voltammetric method for the determination of 3-methylmorphine at nanomolar levels in clinical and environmental samples. The proposed method involves the combined application of a glassy carbon electrode modified with reduced graphene oxide, chitosan and bismuth film (Bi-rGO-CTS/GCE) via square-wave voltammetry using 0.04 mol L-1 Britton-Robinson buffer solution (pH 4.0). The application of the technique yielded low limit of detection of 24 x 10(-9) mol L-1 and linear concentration range of 2.5 x 10(-7) to 8.2 x 10(-6) mol L-1. The Bi-rGO-CTS/GCE sensor was successfully applied for the detection of 3-methylmorphine in the presence of other compounds, including paracetamol and caffeine. The results obtained also showed that the application of the sensor for 3-methylmorphine detection did not experience any significant interference in the presence of silicon dioxide, povidone, cellulose, magnesium stearate, urea, ascorbic acid, humic acid and croscarmellose. The applicability of the Bi-rGO-CTS/GCE sensor for the detection of 3-methylmorphine was evaluated using synthetic urine, serum, and river water samples through addition and recovery tests, and the results obtained were found to be similar to those obtained for the high-performance liquid chromatography method (HPLC)-used as a reference method. The findings of this study show that the proposed voltammetric method is a simple, fast and highly efficient alternative technique for the detection of 3-methylmorphine in both biological and environmental samples.

However, a conventional two-step method involving pre-forming gold nanoparticles and their subsequent deposition on carbon is inconvenient and uneconomical. Herein, carbon supported gold/gold sulfide nanoparticles (ca. 4.2 nm) and gold/gold(iii) compound nanoparticles (ca. 4.1 nm) were synthesized via an in situ one-step procedure using sodium sulfide (SS) and urea (UR) as precipitating agents, respectively. Preliminary electroreduction at -0.78 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in CO2-saturated KHCO3 could reduce and reconstruct the two freshly prepared catalysts, i.e., Au-SS/C and Au-UR/C, into carbon-supported metallic gold nanoparticles with a somewhat larger size and result in a substantial removal of residual CTAC ligands. Detectable amounts of mono- and poly-sulfides remained on the Au surface of the reduced Au-SS/C. Studies on electrocatalytic CO2 reduction revealed that the electrochemically reduced forms of Au-SS/C and Au-UR/C deliver 1.7-fold and 2-fold enhanced maximum CO current densities at around -0.96 V versus RHE compared with polycrystalline Au foil, respectively. Besides, they exhibit CO faradaic efficiencies as high as 91.8% and 94.2%, respectively, and show good long-term stability. Argon-annealing of the two freshly prepared catalysts could also transform the gold sulfide and gold(iii) compound into metallic gold, but decreased the number and/or accessibility of active sites, being proved as a counterproductive strategy for electroreduction of CO2 to CO.

In this study, hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) formation affected by straw returning and nitrogen fertilizer application in paddy soil was investigated in the soil surface water.MethodsIn this study, laboratory simulation experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of straw returning (wheat straw and rape straw, 1% w/w) and nitrogen fertilizer application (urea, 130 mg/kg) on (OH)-O-center dot production in the surface water of paddy field. The amount of (OH)-O-center dot was quantified via chemical probes.Results and discussionIt found that straw returning, regardless of straw type, decreased the formation of (OH)-O-center dot, while nitrogen fertilizer application increased (OH)-O-center dot formation. Correlation analysis showed that dissolved organic matter (DOM) and NO3- affected (OH)-O-center dot production during the early stage of incubation (0-14 days), whereas NO2- produced by denitrification had a great effect on (OH)-O-center dot production at the later stage (14-63 days). Although DOM content increased after straw return, NO3- and NO2- decreased sharply, which possibly accounted for the lower (OH)-O-center dot formation in the straw-amended paddy soil.ConclusionThis study provides a theoretical basis for (OH)-O-center dot formation in the surface water of paddy fields, which is essential for understanding the transformation of pollutants in such environments.

In this research, a simple and high-efficiency hard template method has been successfully developed by adopting carbon nanoparticles obtained from carbonation of polyethylene oxide and urea. The abundant -C-O-C- groups on the surface of carbon nanoparticles provide the high hydrophilicity (from -C-O-C- to -C-O-H) in the alkaline synthetic gel solution, which promotes the synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite and the aluminum condensation in the silica framework to improve the Bronsted acidity. The as-synthesized hierarchical zeolites exhibited two sets of channel systems: micropores (similar to 0.55 nm) are from the MFI framework network, and mesopores (similar to 12.5 and similar to 34.5 nm) result from carbon nanoparticles of 10-40 nm in size, respectively. The hierarchical ZSM-5 with minimized extraframework aluminum species showed catalytic performance with high ethanol conversion (100%) and high stability (lifetime above 30 h) in the ethanol to olefins conversion. Importantly, the diffusion efficiency in ZSM-5 with mesoporous size was remarkably improved, compared to the catalyst with mesoporous size similar to 12.5 nm. As the benzylation of mesitylene with benzyl alcohol, the ZSM-5 (similar to 34.5 nm) sample showed the highest conversion in benzyl alcohol (82.0%) and selectivity in 2-benzyl-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (74.3%).

Enhancing generation of O-2(center dot-) from solid peroxides is a promising strategy to accelerate the rate-limiting step. Herein, the H2O2 release and Fenton-like reactions of four solid peroxides, MgO2, CaO2, ZnO2 and urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP), were investigated. Results indicated that UHP can release H2O2 instantly and show a similar behavior as H2O2 in the Fenton-like reactions. MgO2 released H2O2 quickly in phosphate buffered solutions, which was comparable to CaO2 but faster than ZnO2. Metal peroxides induced higher initial phenol degradation rates than UHP and H2O2 when the same theoretic H2O2 dosages and Fe(III)EDTA were used. MgO2 displayed a superior performance for phenol degradation at pH 5, resulting in more than 93% phenol reduction at 1.5 h. According to kinetic analyses, the generation rate of O-2(center dot-) in the MgO2 system was 18 and 3.4 times higher than those in ZnO2 and CaO2 systems, respectively. The addition of MgO2 significantly promoted H2O2 based Fenton-like reactions by increasing production of O-2(center dot-), and the mixture of MgO2 and H2O2 had an improved utilization efficiency of active oxygen than the MgO2 system. The findings suggested the critical roles of metal peroxides in favoring Fenton-like reactions and inspired strategies to simultaneously accelerate Fenton-like reactions and improve utilization efficiency of active oxygen.

In this respect, a novel and efficient AOPs-based dual-environmental digestion method for the determination of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in waters with complex components is proposed, in the hopes of improving the detection efficiency and accuracy of total nitrogen via online monitoring. The results show that inorganic and organic N-compounds have higher conversion rates in alkaline and acidic conditions, respectively. Meanwhile, the experimental results on the influence of Cl-, CO32-, and HCO3- on the digestion process indicate that Cl- can convert to radical reactive halogen species (RHS) in order to promote digestion efficiency, but CO32- and HCO3- cause a cyclic reaction consuming numerous & BULL;OH, weakening the digestion efficiency. Ultimately, to verify the effectiveness of this novel digestion method, total dissolved nitrogen samples containing ammonium chloride, urea, and glycine in different proportions were digested under the optimal conditions: flow rate, 0.6 L/min; reaction temperature, 40 & DEG;C; pH in acidic conditions, 2; digestion time in acidic condition, 10 min; pH in alkaline conditions, 11; digestion time in alkaline conditions, 10 min. The conversion rate (CR) of samples varied from 93.23% to 98.64%; the mean CR was greater than 95.30%. This novel and efficient digestion method represents a potential alternative for the digestion of N-compounds in the routine analysis or online monitoring of water quality.

J	Sudrajat, H; Babel, S; Sakai, H; Takizawa, S				Sudrajat, Hanggara; Babel, Sandhya; Sakai, Hiroshi; Takizawa, Satoshi			Rapid enhanced photocatalytic degradation of dyes using novel N-doped ZrO2	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												A novel N-doped ZrO2 (N-ZrO2) photocatalyst is synthesized through thermal decomposition of zirconium hydroxide-urea complex and is characterized using various techniques, including XRD, FTIR, TGA, SEM, TEM, UV-DRS, XPS, XANES, and BET. The N-ZrO2 possesses pure monoclinic structure with high crystallinity. By using the proposed facile route of synthesis, both interstitial and substitutional N doping with high dopant stability can be realized. The optical properties of the catalyst are significantly altered after N doping, giving an optical response in the visible and near infrared regions and an additional strong absorption peak in the UVA region. The N-ZrO2 showed a higher photocatalytic activity than pristine ZrO2 for the degradation of amaranth (AM) and methylene blue (MB) under visible or UV light irradiation, which could be attributed to the band gap narrowing, higher specific area, smaller crystalline size, and higher availability of surface hydroxyl groups. Due to its molecular structure and light absorption characteristics, MB is easier to degrade than AM. Overall removal efficiencies, including adsorption and photolysis, for AM and MB by N-ZrO2 at pH 7 with initial dye concentration of 10 mg/L, catalyst concentration of 1 g/L, and visible light irradiation of 144.7 W/m(2) are 67.2 and 96%, respectively. Using UVA light of only 3.5 W/m(2) under identical experimental conditions, complete removal of MB and AM is obtained. The photocatalytically treated solution of either AM or MB is nontoxic against Bacillus cereus, an agriculturally important soil microorganism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

First, magnetite-silica nanoparticles were prepared and functionalized by -NH2 groups using 3-amino propyl triethoxysilane (APTES). Subsequently, the aliphatic Schiff base ligand was immobilized through a condensation reaction between the -NH2 groups on the magnetite-silica and the -C=O groups of acetylacetone. The supported Schiff base complex of Ni(II) on magnetite-silica was synthesized by a reaction between immobilized Schiff base and Ni(II) acetate tetrahydrate salt. Finally, the immobilized Ni(II) Schiff base complex was fully characterized using several techniques including, FT-IR, VSM, XRD, FE-SEM, EDX, TEM, BET, TGA-DTA, and AAS. The magnetically recoverable core-shell nanocatalyst, demonstrated remarkable catalytic activity in the synthesis of 3,4-dihydropyrimidine-2-(1H)-one. This reaction involved three components: an aldehyde, beta-keto ester, and urea, and was carried out via the solvent-free Biginelli reaction. The results indicate that the products are synthesized in good to excellent yields (82-91%) within 13-22 min. At the end of the reaction, the nanocatalyst can be easily removed from the reaction mixture using an external magnet and reused several times. The synthesized products were purified and characterized by FT-IR and 1H NMR techniques.					moradian, mohsen/R-3062-2017														0922-6168	1568-5675				MAY	2024	50	5					2067	2090		10.1007/s11164-024-05273-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11164-024-05273-x		APR 2024											WOS:001197847500002

During the service of cement-based materials, the performance of cement-based materials will be affected after the cement surface is exposed to pollutants. Not only can the surface of cement treated with a photocatalyst degrade pollutants, but it can also protect the cement-based materials from being destroyed. In this study, graphite carbon nitride-silica composite materials were synthesized by thermal polymerization using nanosilica and urea as raw materials. The effect of nanosilica content and specific surface area were investigated with the optimal condition attained to be 0.15 g and 300 m(2)/g, respectively. An X-ray diffractometer, thermogravimetric analyzer, scanning electron microscope, a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area analyzer and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer were utilized for the characterization of as-prepared graphite carbon nitride-silica composite materials. Subsequently, the surface of cement-based materials was treated with graphite carbon nitride-silica composite materials by the one-sided immersion and brushing methods for the study of photocatalytic performance. By comparing the degradation effect of Rhodamine B, it was found that the painting method is more suitable for the surface treatment of cement. In addition, through the reaction of calcium hydroxide and graphite carbon nitride-silica composite materials, it was found that the combination of graphite carbon nitride-silica composite materials and cement is through C-S-H gel.

The synthesized nanomaterial (Nb-N-TiO2) was characterized via Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, UV-Visible (UV-Vis) Spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), BrunauerEmmett-Teller (BET) technique, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) technique and ZETA Potential analysis. The band gap of Nb-N-TiO2 was reduced as compared to TiO2 due to reduced space between valance and conduction band which also reduced the electron-hole (e-, h+) recombination and led to better photocatalytic activity of the Nb-N-TiO2 as confirmed by TAUC plot. Photocatalytic activity of Nb-N-TiO2 was investigated for degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye under sunlight as cheaper light source. Factors like dye concentration, dosage of catalyst, volume of solution time and pH were studied and optimized for MB degradation. Under finally optimized conditions, 97% of 25 ppm MB was degraded just in one minute using 45 mg of photocatalyst. The codoped nanocatalyst, was re-used for MB degradation upto 4th cycle with its efficiency reduced to 75% which shows a better catalytic role by the catalyst. Degradation products of MB were recognized through electrospray ionization coupled mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) and liquid chromatography coupled mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) techniques. The catalyst was also applied for MB degradation in tap water sample.

Microcystis blooms were tightly linked with Pseudanabaena in summer and were accompanied by significant changes in the non-cyanobacterial community composition (nCCC) compared to non-bloom period. Riverine bacterial communities could be clearly separated into modules that were involved in the formation, maintenance, and decomposition of cyanoHABs. Roseomonas and Herbaspirillum were directly linked with major cyanobacteria and assigned to connector and module hub in cyanoHABs-related modules, respectively. The functional profiles of the cyanoHABs-related modules suggested that nitrate reduction, aerobic ammonia oxidation, fermentation, and hydrocarbon degradation could be increased during the Microcystis bloom periods. In conclusion, MRAN analysis revealed that specific bacteria belonging to cyanoHABs-related module, including connectors and module hubs, appeared to contribute to the development and collapse of cyanoHABs. Therefore, to understand cyanoHABs, a modular microbial perspective may be more helpful than a single bacterial species perspective.

The g-C3N4@ZnO NRA was prepared via improved urea impregnation and calcination methods in semi enclosed environment. The g-C3N4 flexible slice shell was uniformly wrapped on ZnO nanorods core and the intimately contacted heterojunction was formed between the interface of g-C3N4 and ZnO. The g-C3N4@ZnO NRA promotes the separation and transfer of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs on g-C3N4 and ZnO under either visible light or white light illumination. The prepared g-C3N4@ZnO NRA was further electrodeposited with Co-Pi nanoparticles (NPs). The Co-Pi NPs can assist in the consumption of the photoinduced holes as well as pull the Fermi level potential of g-C3N4@ZnO NRAs towards the positive direction, resulting in the upward band bending at the band-edge position for Co-Pi/g-C3N4@ZnO NRAs and promoting the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Consequently, the Co-Pi/g-C3N4@ZnO NRA exhibits an improved PEC performance under both visible light and white light illumination. In addition, g-C3N4 flexible slice shell decorated with Co-Pi NPs covered on the surface of ZnO NRAs core improved the stability of the ZnO NRA photoanode. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

XRD confirmed that product is consists of zinc and oxygen atoms forming a hexagonal crystal system with ZnO chemical formula. SEM showed that tubes and flower like particles are formed. ATR-IR confirmed the presence of Zn-O bond as a functional group. UV-VIS spectroscopic analysis exhibits that product has a band gap energy of 3.49 eV. Synthesized product due to its outstanding properties such as wide band gap semiconductor and large surface area to volume ratio is used as a catalyst for individual and simultaneous catalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) and Congo red (CR) dyes. The apparent rate constant (k(app)) value of individual and simultaneous catalytic degradation of CR dye is decreased with increase in catalyst dosage while k(app) value of individual and simultaneous catalytic degradation of MB dye is increased with increase in catalyst dosage. The synthesized product is found more active towards CR dye as compared to MB dye. Small size and high surface area to volume ratio of product also make it a desirable additive for enhancing the efficiency of diesel fuel. Results obtained from fuel additive activity show that as the concentration of nanoadditive is increased from 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 ppm the calorific value is increased which indicates the enhanced efficiency of fuel due to additive.					faisal, M/GQB-4757-2022; AQIB, AMJAD/AAE-6956-2020; Jamil, Saba/ABM-9687-2022; Janjua, Muhammad Ramzan Saeed Ashraf/ACU-2640-2022; Khan, Shanza/AAB-7476-2020	Faisal, Muhammad/0000-0001-6448-9325; Jamil, Saba/0000-0001-7950-2916; Aqib, Amjad Islam/0000-0001-7618-3948													2365-6549					MAY 24	2019	4	19					5548	5559		10.1002/slct.201900645	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/slct.201900645													WOS:000468976000025

For this purpose, radio-frequency-based (RF) catalyst state determination offers the only approach for directly measuring the NH3 loading on selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts and the state of other catalysts and filter systems. Recently, the ability of this technique to directly control the urea dosing on a current NH3 storing zeolite catalyst has been demonstrated on an engine dynamometer for the first time and this paper continues that work. Therefore, a well-known serial-type and zeolite-based SCR catalyst (Cu-SSZ-13) was investigated under deliberately chosen high space velocities. At first, the full functionality of the RF system with Cu-SSZ-13 as sample was tested successfully. By direct RF-based NH3 storage control, the influence of the storage degree on the catalyst performance, i.e., on NOx conversion and NH3 slip, was investigated in a temperature range between 250 and 400 degrees C. For each operation point, an ideal and a critical NH3 storage degree was found and analyzed in the whole temperature range. Based on the data of all experimental runs, temperature dependent calibration functions were developed as a basis for upcoming tests under transient conditions. Additionally, the influence of exhaust humidity was observed with special focus on cold start water and its effects to the RF signals.

Kapok fibre was used as a bio-templates and in-situ C doping in g-C3N4 and TiO2 during the formation of core-shell heterojunction photocatalyst. Moreover, the used of urea as g-C3N4-precursor also contribute to band-gap narrowing by an in-situ carbon and nitrogen doping in TiO2. Various characterisation techniques were employed to understand the effect TiO2 precursor concentration on the evolution of core-shell nanostructure heterojunction photocatalyst that can affect and boost the catalytic activity. The detailed understanding of the concurrent growth of C-doped g-C3N4(CCN) and C, N co-doped TiO2 mechanism, as well as the formation of core-shell nanostructures heterojunction formation, are also proposed in this study. Our finding indicated that the biotemplate core-shell nanostructure heterojunction photocatalysts showed a dramatic increase in photoinduced electron-hole separation efficiency as demonstrated by the photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence analyses. The enhancement in photogenerated charge carrier separation and narrower band gap resulted in superior photocatalytic activities with the highest rate of hydrogen production was recorded by CCN/T-1.5 sample (625.5 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) in methanol aqueous solution. The well-developed interconnected heterojunction formation with appropriate CCN and TiO2 contents in core-shell nanoarchitectures system is a prime factor for the future design of a highly efficient visible-light-driven photocatalyst.

Hybrid cell membrane-coated nanoparticles derived from different cell types can mimic the surface properties and functionalities of the source cells, further enhancing their targeting precision and therapeutic efficacy. Neuroinflammation has been increasingly recognized as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of various NDs, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, a novel cell membrane coating is designed by hybridizing the membrane from platelets and chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) cells are overexpressed to cross the BBB and target neuroinflammatory lesions. Past unsuccessful endeavors in AD drug development underscore the challenge of achieving favorable outcomes when utilizing single-mechanism drugs.Two drugs with different mechanisms of actions into liposomes are successfully loaded to realize multitargeting treatment. In a transgenic mouse model for familial AD (5xFAD), the administration of these drug-loaded hybrid cell membrane liposomes results in a significant reduction in amyloid plaque deposition, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairments. Collectively, the hybrid cell membrane-coated nanomaterials offer new opportunities for precise drug delivery and disease-specific targeting, which represent a versatile platform for targeted therapy in AD. A novel cell membrane coating is designed by hybridizing the membranes from platelets and chemokine receptor 2 overexpressing cells to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and target neuroinflammatory lesions. Rapamycin and 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU) are loaded into the liposomes to achieve a synergistic therapy.

The differences between microbial communities and their functional potential in surface to hadopelagic water samples are only beginning to be explored. Here, we used metagenomics to investigate the microbial communities and their potential to drive biogeochemical cycling in seven different water layers down the vertical profile of the Challenger Deep (0-10,500 m) in the Mariana Trench, the deepest natural point in the Earth's oceans. We recovered 726 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) affiliated to 27 phyla. Overall, biodiversity increased in line with increased depth. In addition, the genome size of MAGs at >= 4000 m layers was slightly larger compared to those at 0-2000 m. As expected, surface waters were the main source of primary production, predominantly from Cyanobacteria. Intriguingly, microbes conducting an unusual form of nitrogen metabolism were identified in the deepest waters (>10,000 m), as demonstrated by an enrichment of genes encoding proteins involved in dissimilatory nitrate to ammonia conversion (DNRA), nitrogen fixation and urea transport. These likely facilitate the survival of ammonia-oxidizing archaea alpha lineage, which are typically present in environments with a high ammonia concentration. In addition, the microbial potential for oxidative phosphorylation and the glyoxylate shunt was enhanced in >10,000 m waters. This study provides novel insights into how microbial communities and their genetic potential for biogeochemical cycling differs through the Challenger deep water column, and into the unique adaptive lifestyle of microbes in the Earth's deepest seawater.

By varying many experimental parameters such as the temperature, the hydrothermal reaction time, the pH of the solution and the surfactant's nature, we have successfully obtained BiVO4 (monoclinic)/TiO2 (anatase) nanomaterials with different morphologies. These materials were characterized by X-ray powder Diffraction (XRD), Infrared Spectroscopy (IR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The as-prepared nanocomposites were employed to manufacture hybrid electrode sensors to detect H2O2. The BiVO4/TiO2 nanocomposite was deposited on nickel foam which acts as the working electrode. The response to hydrogen peroxide on the formed electrode was examined using cyclic voltammetry and amperometry techniques. Due to the synergic effect and the nanometric character of the BiVO4/TiO2 nanocomposite, the synthesized sensor shows an enhanced electrochemical sensing performance. Under optimal conditions, the H2O2 sensing tests indicate that the as-prepared BiVO4/TiO2 electrochemical sensor exhibits a low detection limit (5 mu M), a high sensitivity (3014 mu A/mM), which is two times larger than that of BiVO4 and TiO2, a large linear range (5-400 mu M), and long-term stability. Finally, the practical applications of the BiVO4/TiO2 electrochemical sensor were also evaluated by analyzing H2O2 in the presence of common interfering species such as uric acid, ascorbic acid, vitamin-B12, glycine, asparagine, glucose, urea, KNO3, NaNO3 and NaCl. The as-obtained results confirm the high selectivity towards H2O2 of the BiVO4/TiO2 electrode. These results could open the route for potential applications of the BiVO4/TiO2-based sensor in many fields such as: biomedicine, environmental detection, electrochemical sensing and pharmaceutical analysis.

J	Sun, Y; Ahmadi, Y; Kim, KH				Sun, Yang; Ahmadi, Younes; Kim, Ki-Hyun			The selection of a nitrogen precursor for the construction of N-doped titanium dioxide with enhanced photocatalytic activity for the removal of gaseous toluene	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The preparation of nitrogen-doped TiO2 (i.e., N-TiO2) catalysts is a highly effective option to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Nonetheless, relatively little is known about the effects of dopant precursors selected for their preparation with regard to the photocatalytic efficacy. In this study, three types of dopants are selected and used as N sources (urea (U), melamine (M), and aqueous ammonia (A)) for N-TiO2 samples with the name codes of NTU, NTM, and NTA, respectively. The photocatalytic efficacy of these N-TiO2 samples is examined against toluene in a packed bed flow reactor. Under optimal conditions (e.g., relative humidity (RH) = 20% and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) = 1698 h-1), the superiority of NTA is evident over others with a quantum efficiency (QE) of 7.03 x 10-4 molecules photon- 1, a space time yield (STY) of 1.38 x 10-4 molecules photon- 1 mg-1, and a specific clean air delivery rate (SCADR) of 1148.8 L g- 1 h-1. The analysis based on in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry confirms the formation of several intermediates such as benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, and alkane species through ring opening reactions. In addition, the prepared NTA photocatalyst exhibits the highest toluene photocatalytic degradation efficiency among all TiO2-based catalysts surveyed to date.

These catalysts demonstrated excellent performance in pyrazines degradation and odor elimination. The synthesis of Mn-nN was achieved through a facile urea-assisted heat treatment method. Experimental characterization and theoretical analyses revealed that the Mn-N structures in Mn-nN, played a crucial role in facilitating the formation of electron-dense Mn sites that served as the primary active sites for ozone activation. In particular, Mn-1N exhibited excellent performance in the HCO system, demonstrating the highest 2,5-dimethylpyrazine (2,5-DMP) degradation efficiency. center dot OH was confirmed as the primary reactive oxygen species involved in the HCO process. The second-order rate constants for 2,5-DMP degradation with O3 and center dot OH, were determined to be (3.75 +/- 0.018) x 10-1 and (6.29 +/- 0.844) x 109 M-1 s- 1 DMP via HCO process with Mn-1N. The degradation pathways were subsequently proposed by considering these identified intermediates. This study introduces a novel approach to synthesize N-doped Mn3O4 catalysts and demonstrates their efficacy in HCO for the degradation of pyrazines and the elimination of associated odors. The results show that the catalysts are promising for addressing odor-related environmental issues and provide valuable insights about the broader significance of catalytic ozonation processes. , respectively.

In this work, we set out to investigate the specific role of K+ and of its counter-ion (Cl- or NO3-) on the combined poisoning effect induced on the catalytic features of a MnOx/TiO2 system. Poisoning of the catalyst was performed ex situ by impregnation with two target loadings of each K salt, followed by a mild thermal treatment at 250 degrees C, corresponding to the maximum operating temperature of the SCR system. Fresh and poisoned catalysts were characterized by means of ICP-MS, BET, H-2-TPR, NH3-Adsorption, NH3-Temperature Programmed Desorption-Reaction and in situ DRIFT and the impact of poisoning was assessed and compared for the NH3-SCR of NO as well as for the NH3-SCO (Selective Catalytic Oxidation) reaction.

APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL												The effect of gold addition to iridium catalysts and the nature of active sites for citral hydrogenation were investigated over Ir-Au/TiO2 catalysts. All samples (Au/TiO2, Ir/TiO2 and Ir-AulTiO(2)) were prepared by deposition-precipitation with urea (DPU). Bimetallic catalysts were synthetized by co-deposition at different Ir/Au atomic ratios (3, 1, 0.3). The catalysts were characterized by ICP, BET, H-2-TPR, H-2-Chemisorption, TEM, DRIFTS and XPS techniques. A partial coverage of iridium sites by gold atoms takes place as the gold amount in the catalyst increases as shown by chemisorption and XPS measurements. The latter also evidenced a trend consistent with modification of the electronic environment of iridium due to interaction with gold atoms. Also, compared to Ir/TiO2, the amount of Ir delta+ species was higher in the bimetallic catalysts reaching a maximum in Ir-Au (1) sample. Characterization of the catalytic surface using DRIFTS of adsorbed CO evidenced a shift towards higher wavenumbers as a function of the gold content indicating, as the XPS results, a modification of the adsorption site. The catalytic activity for citral hydrogenation increased as a function of the gold content. The selectivity to unsaturated alcohol is related to the amount of Ir delta+ species which in turns depends on the catalyst composition. For the most active sample Ir-Au (1), a suitable Ir delta+/Ir-0 ratio is already obtained when the catalyst is reduced at 573 K and does not vary with reduction temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Water electrolysis is one of the most convenient processes to produce high purity hydrogen. Cobalt-based catalysts are well-known electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this article, all these merits indicate that the present cobalt nanocomposite is a promising electrocatalyst for OER. C-Co3O4-nanorods catalyst with nanorod structure was synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of CoCl2 center dot 6H(2)O/dextrose/urea mixture at 180 degrees C for 18 h and then calcined at 400 degrees C for 3.5 h. The role of dextrose percentage in solution to achieve the uniform coating of carbon on the surface of Co3O4-nanorods has been demonstrated. The prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller instrument (BET). Due to its unique morphology, the C-Co3O4-nanorods catalyst exhibited better activity than Co3O4-microplates catalyst for OER in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The results showed a highly efficient, scalable, and low-cost method for developing highly active and stable OER electrocatalysts in alkaline solution.

The effect of CuCo2O4-x catalysts on soot conversion and CO2 selectivity in both loose and tight contact mode was investigated. The CuCo2O4-N catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic activity with the characteristic temperatures (T-10, T-50 and T-90) of 451 degrees C, 520 degrees C and 558 degrees C, respectively, while the CO2 selectivity reached 98.8% during the reaction. With the addition of NO, the soot combustion was further accelerated over all catalysts. Compared with the loose contact mode, the soot conversion was improved in the tight contact mode. The CuCo2O4-N catalysts showed better textural properties compared to the CuCo2O4-A and CuCo2O4-C, such as higher specific surface areas and pore volumes. The XRD results confirmed that the formation of a CuCo2O4 crystal phase in all catalysts. However, the CuO crystal phase only presented in CuCo2O4-N and CuCo2O4-A. The relative contents of Cu2+, Co3+ and O-ads on the surface of CuCo2O4-x (x = N, A and C) catalysts were analyzed by XPS. The CuCo2O4-N catalyst displayed the highest relative content of Cu2+, Co3+ and O-ads. The activity of catalytic soot combustion showed a good correlation with the order of the relative contents of Cu2+, Co3+ and O-ads. Additionally, the CuCo2O4-N catalyst exhibited lower reduction temperature compared to the CuCo2O4-A and CuCo2O4-C. The cycle tests clarified that the copper-cobalt spinel catalyst obtained good stability. In addition, based on the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the process of catalytic soot combustion was described combined with the electron transfer process and the role of oxygen species over CuCo2O4 spinel catalysts.

In this paper, an algal strain Scenedesmus sp. was isolated from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP); its interaction effect with wastewater bacteria on the removal of IMI and conventional pollutants in municipal wastewater was evaluated. RESULTS In this study, an algae-bacteria system was constructed with municipal wastewater, with the aim of exploring the removal effects and mechanisms of the consortium system on Imidacloprid (IMI, 20 mg L-1 and 60 mg L-1) and conventional nutrients from municipal wastewater. The results showed that no IMI was removed under 20 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). However, under 60 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), more than 90% of IMI was removed in the algae-wastewater group (AWG) with Scenedesmus sp.; this value is much higher than the 50.4% (20 mg L-1) and 36.1% (60 mg L-1) achieved by the wastewater group (WG) without Scenedesmus sp. Meanwhile, the removal efficiency of nitrogen was 82.3% (20 mg L-1) and 71.9% (60 mg L-1) in AWG, both of which are higher than the 73.4% and 59.1% in WG, respectively. Moreover, Scenedesmus sp. TXH has a strong resistance to IMI and 4 degradation products (including IMI-urea, 4(5)-hydroxy-IMI, Nitrosimine, and a substance with m/z of 176) were found in AWG. CONCLUSION Using consortium to treat municipal wastewater containing IMI is an effective and safe way. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).

Bioefficacy of dietary inclusion of Nannochloropsis oculata on Eimeria spp. challenged chicks: clinical approaches, meat quality, and molecular docking	AVIAN PATHOLOGY												Although anticoccidial drugs have been used to treat avian coccidiosis for nearly a century, resistance, bird harm, and food residues have caused health concerns. Thus, Nannochloropsis oculata was investigated as a possible coccidiosis treatment for broilers. A total of 150 1-day-old male Cobb broiler chicks were treated as follows: G1-Ng: fed a basal diet; G2-Ps: challenged with Eimeria spp. oocysts and fed basal diet; G3-Clo: challenged and fed basal diet with clopidol; G4-NOa: challenged and fed 0.1% N. oculata in diet, and G5-NOb: challenged and fed 0.2% N. oculata. Compared to G2-Ps, N. oculata in the diet significantly (P < 0.05) decreased dropping scores, lesion scores, and oocyst shedding. Without affecting breast meat colour metrics, N. oculata improved meat quality characters. At 28 days of age, birds received 0.2% N. oculata had significantly (P < 0.05) higher serum levels of MDA, T-SOD, HDL, and LDL cholesterol compared to G2-Ps. Serum AST, ALT, and urea levels were all decreased when N. oculata (0.2%) was used as opposed to G2-Ps. Histopathological alterations and the number of developmental and degenerative stages of Eimeria spp. in the intestinal epithelium were dramatically reduced by 0.2% N. oculata compared to G2-Ps. Molecular docking revealed a higher binding affinity of N. oculata for E. tenella aldolase, EtAMA1, and EtMIC3, which hindered glucose metabolism, host cell adhesion, and invasion of Eimeria. Finally, N. oculata (0.2%) can be used in broiler diets to mitigate the deleterious effects of coccidiosis.

Plasmonic Ag nanoparticle decorated Bi2O3/CuBi2O4 photocatalyst for expeditious degradation of 17α-ethinylestradiol and Cr(VI) reduction: Insight into electron transfer mechanism and enhanced photocatalytic activity	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												In this study, we have developed a facile and less time consuming one pot solution combustion method to prepare Bi2O3/CuBi2O4 (BO/CBO) and CuO/CuBi2O4 (CO/CBO) heterojunction materials by optimizing the Cu/Bi/urea molar ratio. The as prepared optimal Bi2O3/CuBi2O4 binary material was further modified by plasmonic Ag nanoparticles to construct Bi2O3/CuBi2O4/Ag (BO/CBO/Ag) ternary composite material. Comprehensive characterization of the ternary composite using a variety of techniques confirmed fast electron channelization, improved charge carrier separation and prolonged life time of the excited state. The ternary composite exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for 17-alpha Ethinylestradiol (EE2) degradation (94.6%) and Cr(VI) reduction (96.9%) under visible light irradiation with an apparent rate constant value of 0.0185 min-1 and 0.1147 min(-1), respectively. The hydroxyl ((OH)-O-center dot) and superoxide (O-center dot(2)-) radicals were identified as the major active species responsible for photocatalytic action. The electron transfer mechanism in BO/CBO/Ag material is probed using photoelectrochemical characterization and spectroscopic method (PL, UV?Vis and ESR) employing different molecular probes. The substantially staggered band alignment between the BO and CBO semiconductors and formation of an internal electric field at the interfacial region ensures smooth passage of electron from the CB of BO to the VB of CBO forming a step (S) scheme heterojunction. The Ag metal acts as an electron reservoir as well as surface Plasmon which help in achieving higher charge carrier separation and improved photocatalytic activity.

Complexes were characterized by using SC-XRD, FT-IR and UV-Visible spectroscopic techniques. The complex (1) [Cu(dmp)2]ClO4 crystallized in the Orthorhombic with the space group P 21 21 21, a = 11.9229(2) a, b = 12.4823(3) a, c = 18.2499(3) a and Complex (2) [Cu(phen)2Br] crystallized in the Monoclinic with the space group C2/c, a = 23.247(5) a, b = 30.731 (6) a, c = 7.5317(15) a and 13 = 97.677(6)o. The FMOs study based on DFT showed the complex (2) has high value of chemical softness and more easily polarized compare to complex (1). The HOMO-LUMO energy gap in complex (2) is small compared to complex (1) due to which there is easier intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in complex (2) which support the higher third order NLO (y) response of the complex (2). The statistical calculations for Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and the P values showed that the selected level of theory is appropriate for the theoretical calculations of the complexes. Theoretical calculation showed that both the complexes have higher third order NLO response compared to prototypical urea.																			0022-2860	1872-8014				DEC 5	2023	1293								136254	10.1016/j.molstruc.2023.136254	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2023.136254		AUG 2023											WOS:001052900200001

Boosting the photocatalytic performance of Bi2Fe4O9 through formation of Z-scheme heterostructure with In2S3: Applications towards water decontamination	CHEMOSPHERE												Design of biocompatible nano-heterostructure photocatalyst with broad UV-visible spectrum response and strong redox ability is a promising approach with potential application in micropollutant degradation and pathogen deactivation from aqueous sources. Herein, we have reported the facile fabrication of In2S3/Bi2Fe4O9 (ISxBFO) binary heterostructure by hydrothermally depositing In2S3 nanoparticles (20-40 nm) over Bi2Fe4O9 nanocuboids/nanoplates prepared by combustion synthesis route. In depth characterization study revealed broad spectrum UV-Vis absorption, large interfacial contact, improved charge carrier separation and mobility and a longer excited state life time (4.7 ns) for the ISxBFO heterostructure materials. The integration of In2S3 with Bi2Fe4O9 strongly boosts the optoelectrical and photocatalytic property of pristine Bi2Fe4O9. The ISxBFO heterostructure material exhibited enhanced photocatalytic efficiency for aqueous phase degradation of sulfamethoxazole antibiotics (k(app) = 0.06 min -1 ) and phenyl urea herbicides (k(app) = 0.028 min(-1)) with reaction rates 3-8 times higher than the pure BFO component. The MTT assay experiments confirmed non-cytotoxic nature of treated sulfamethoxazole and diuron solutions. The composite materials also displayed convincing antibacterial behavior towards toxigenic Vibrio cholerae pathogen. Haemagglutination assay study revealed excellent biocompatibility of the binary composite up to 200 mg L-1. Radical trapping study suggested expeditious generation of (OH)-O-center dot and center dot O-2(-) radicals over the ISxBFO surface which is nearly 3.8 and 2.3 times higher than pure BFO and In2S3 respectively. The occurrence of a direct Z-scheme mechanism is inferred from radical trapping and XPS study which accounted for the improved photocatalytic activity and strong radical generation property of the ISxBFO heterostructure material.

Despite the remarkable effects of local strain, the relationships among local strain, spatial correlation of photogenerated charge carriers, and photocatalytic performance remain elusive. The current study coupled single-molecule localization microscopy with coordinate-based colocalization (CBC) analysis to explain these relationships. The methodology involved mapping the spatial distributions of photoinduced oxidation and reduction reaction sites across graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets, quantifying and spatially resolving their spatial correlation, and also evaluating their photocatalytic activity. The study examined 65 individual g-C3N4 nanosheets, revealing interparticle and intraparticle heterogeneity, which was classified based on their CBC score distributions. Among the 65 g-C3N4 nanosheets, type A nanosheets predominated (45 out of 65) and demonstrated both correlated and noncorrelated subregions along some wrinkles. In contrast, type B nanosheets (20 out of 65) were primarily characterized by noncorrelated subregions with minimal correlated localizations. The coexistence of both noncorrelated and correlated subregions inferred the structure of the wrinkles as folding wrinkles, which have larger tensile-strained areas than rippling wrinkles. Folding wrinkles promote colocalization through the formation of type I band alignment at tensile-strained subregions. This band alignment also enhances photocatalytic activity through a funneling effect and improved light absorption, leading to higher specific activity in correlated subregions compared to noncorrelated ones. The role of strain-induced band alignment in modulating the spatial correlation of the photoredox reaction and the photocatalytic performance at the subregion level is highlighted.

To address this issue, we take advantage of a urea-based chemical bath deposition method (CBD) that enables to control the amount of electrocatalyst (Fe(OH)(2) and alpha-Co(OH)(2)) deposited on conducting glass. The thickness of the resulting films, whose use in electrocatalysis is unprecedented, is tuned by controlling the deposition time. The turnover frequency (TOF) for O-2 generation decreases drastically as the electrocatalyst amount increases from equivalent coverages of 3.5 monolayers (ML) for Fe(OH)(2) and of 0.06 ML for alpha-Co(OH)(2) electrodes. The contrasting behavior of both hydroxides comes from the different structure of the incipient deposits, formed by small acicular nanoparticles in the case of Fe(OH)(2) and larger flat microparticles in the case of alpha-Co(OH)(2). The former structure allows a large fraction of the Fe sites to be in direct contact with solution, while such a fraction rapidly diminishes with loading for alpha-Co(OH)(2). In addition, the resulting Co(OH)(2) electrodes show TOFs similar or higher than those of electrodes prepared by more complex routes. The optimum ultrathin films are remarkably stable in alkaline media, showing that the preparation of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution with an extremely small amount of metal through a novel, facile and scalable CBD is possible.

Key Factors, Soil Nitrogen Processes, and Nitrite Accumulation Affecting Nitrous Oxide Emissions	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												A better understanding of the factors and processes affecting N2O emissions is essential for developing mitigation strategies. This research aimed to examine the factors and processes affecting N2O emissions and N dynamics. Laboratory incubation experiments examined the effects of N (urea) application rate (0-150 mg N kg(-1)); soil water content (5-30%, w/w); temperature (10-40 degrees C); and incorporation of biochar (1%, w/w), a urease inhibitor (Agrotain Ultra), and a nitrification inhibitor (N-Serve 24) on N2O emissions and N transformation dynamics in a Hanford sandy loam soil. Nitrous oxide emissions, soil pH, and mineral N species were monitored for 35 d. Peak emission rates and cumulative losses of N2O increased more than the N application rate increased. Soil water content at 20 and 30% [ above the water holding capacity (WHC) of 12%] resulted in much higher total N2O emissions (9.3 and 8.0% of total soil inorganic N, respectively) than that from 5 and 10% water content (0.2 and 0.3%, respectively). Increasing soil water content above WHC caused higher N2O emissions than increasing the soil temperature, which demonstrates that soil moisture is more significant in affecting the process. Nitrite concentration was highly correlated with N2O emissions within two water content ranges (above or below WHC). Amendment with biochar, Agrotain Ultra, and N-Serve 24 reduced N2O emissions by 74, 78, and 74%, respectively. This research provide further understanding of the processes affecting N2O emissions from soil, which can assist in developing management practices.

J	Zhao, J; Wang, BZ; Jia, ZJ				Zhao, Jun; Wang, Baozhan; Jia, Zhongjun			Phylogenetically Distinct Phylotypes Modulate Nitrification in a Paddy Soil	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Paddy fields represent a unique ecosystem in which regular flooding occurs, allowing for rice cultivation. However, the taxonomic identity of the microbial functional guilds that catalyze soil nitrification remains poorly understood. In this study, we provide molecular evidence for distinctly different phylotypes of nitrifying communities in a neutral paddy soil using high-throughput pyrosequencing and DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP). Following urea addition, the levels of soil nitrate increased significantly, accompanied by an increase in the abundance of the bacterial and archaeal amoA gene in microcosms subjected to SIP (SIP microcosms) during a 56-day incubation period. High-throughput fingerprints of the total 16S rRNA genes in SIP microcosms indicated that nitrification activity positively correlated with the abundance of Nitrosospira-like ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), soil group 1.1b-like ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), and Nitrospira-like nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). Pyrosequencing of C-13-labeled DNA further revealed that (CO2)-C-13 was assimilated by these functional groups to a much greater extent than by marine group 1.1a-associated AOA and Nitrobacter-like NOB. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that active AOB communities were closely affiliated with Nitrosospira sp. strain L115 and the Nitrosospira multiformis lineage and that the C-13-labeled AOA were related to phylogenetically distinct groups, including the moderately thermophilic "Candidatus Nitrososphaera gargensis," uncultured fosmid 29i4, and acidophilic "Candidatus Nitrosotalea devanaterra" lineages. These results suggest that a wide variety of microorganisms were involved in soil nitrification, implying physiological diversification of soil nitrifying communities that are constantly exposed to environmental fluctuations in paddy fields.

Magneto-Optical Properties of Reusable Spinel NixMg1-xFe2O4(0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0) Nano-Catalysts	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												Magnetically recyclable spinel NixMg1-xFe2O4 (0.0 <= x <= 1.0) nanocatalysts were successfully synthesized by a simple urea-assisted microwave combustion method. The formation of single-phase cubic spinel NixMg1-xFe2O4 nano-structures were confirmed by powder XRD, Rietveld refinement XRD method, FT-IR and EDX analysis. The morphology of the samples consists of spherical shaped particle-like nano-crystal structure with well crystalline nature, which was confirmed by HR-SEM, HR-TEM and SAED analysis. The optical properties, band gap (E-g) and defect states of the samples were confirmed by UV-Vis DRS and PL spectroscopy and the E-g of undoped spinel MgFe2O4 sample is 1.81 eV and it is increased with increasing the amount of Ni2+ dopant, due to the decrease of particle size. The magnetic measurements (VSM) showed ferromagnetic behavior for all compositions and the magnetization values are increased with increasing the Ni2+ dopant, due to the higher magnetic moment (2 mu B) of Ni2+ ions substituted the non-magnetic nature of Mg2+ ions (0 mu B) in the spinel MgFe2O4 lattice. The surface area of the samples increased with increasing the concentration of Ni2+ ions upto x = 0.0-0.6 and further increasing the Ni2+ ions (x = 0.8 and 1.0), it is decreased. The higher surface area of the sample Ni0.6Mg0.4Fe2O4 NPs showed better catalytic conversion (96.08%) of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde with 100% selectivity.

Characterizing BCAA catabolism in the postprandial phase could elucidate the impact of protein intake on obesity risk established in the "early protein hypothesis."Objective To examine the acute effects of protein content of young child formulas as test meals on BCAA catabolism, observing postprandial plasma concentrations of BCAA in relation to their degradation products.Methods The TOMI Add-On Study is a randomized, double-blind crossover study in which 27 healthy adults consumed 2 isocaloric young child formulas with alternating higher (HP) and lower (LP) protein and fat content as test meals during separate interventions, while 9 blood samples were obtained over 5 hours. BCAA, branched-chain alpha-keto acids (BCKA), and acylcarnitines were analyzed using a fully targeted HPLC-ESI-MS/MS approach.Results Mean concentrations of BCAA, BCKA, and acylcarnitines were significantly higher after HP than LP over the 5 postprandial hours, except for the BCKA alpha-ketoisovalerate (KIVA). The latter metabolite showed higher postprandial concentrations after LP. With increasing mean concentrations of BCAA, concentrations of corresponding BCKA, acylcarnitines, and urea increased until a breakpoint was reached, after which concentrations of degradation products decreased (for all metabolites except valine and KIVA and Carn C4:0-iso).Conclusion BCAA catabolism is markedly influenced by protein content of the test meal. We present novel evidence for the apparent saturation of the BCAA degradation pathway in the acute postprandial phase up to 5 hours after consumption.

We previously found that high-dose thiamine therapy prevents overnutrition-induced hepatic steatosis in sheep by enhancing oxidative catabolism. Based on this capacity, we hypothesized that thiamine might also reduce whole-body fat and weight. To test it, we investigated the effects of high-dose thiamine treatment in sheep under overnutrition and calorie-restricted undernutrition to respectively induce positive energy balance (PEB) and negative energy balance (NEB). Eighteen mature ewes were randomly assigned to three treatment groups (n = 6 each). The control group (CG) was administered daily with subcutaneous saline, whereas the T5 and T10 groups were administered daily with equivoque of saline containing 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of thiamine, respectively. Bodyweight and blood biochemistry were measured twice a week for a period of 22 days under PEB and for a consecutive 30 days under NEB. Surprisingly, despite the strong effect of thiamine on liver fat, no effect on body weight or blood glucose was detectable. Thiamine did, however, increase plasma concentration of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) during NEB (575.5 +/- 26.7, 657.6 +/- 29.9 and 704.9 +/- 26.1 mu EqL(-1) for CG, T5, and T10, respectively: p < 0.05), thereby favoring utilization of fatty acids versus carbohydrates as a source of energy. Thiamine increased serum creatinine concentrations (p < 0.05), which paralleled a trending increase in urea (p = 0.09). This may indicate an increase in muscle metabolism by thiamine. Reduction of fat content by thiamine appears more specific to the liver than to adipose tissue. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the potential implications of high-dose vitamin B1 therapy in muscle metabolism.

However, synthesis of CaCO3 on the form of very thin sporadic layer attaching rGO results in dramatic increase in the specific capacitance of the obtained composite due to formation of the electrochemical double layer at the interfacial area. Moreover, the specific capacitance could be further enhanced by nitrogen-doping of the rGO sheets. Typically, a novel N-rGO/CaCO3 composite has been successfully synthesized by heat reflux strategy with graphite powder, calcium acetate and urea as raw materials. The composite was characterized by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), coupled with rapid EDAX (energy dispersive analysis of X-Ray) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The utilized physiochemical characterizations indicated that the final prepared composite can be demonstrated as N-doped rGO decorated by very thin discrete layer from calcium carbonate. Supercapacitive performance of N-rGO/CaCO3 composite has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 1 M KOH solution. The results reveal that the N-rGO/CaCO3 composite delivers a large specific capacitance of as high as 214 Fg(-1) and 188 Fg(-1) at 5 mV s(-1) and 1.0 Ag-1, according to CV and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests, respectively; while the CaCO3, rGO, rGO/CaCO3, N-rGO based electrodes has a poor electrochemical performance at the same conditions. Moreover, the as-prepared composite exhibited excellent long cycle stability with about 88.7% specific capacitance retained after 10,000 cycles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nitrification inhibitors impose distinct effects on comammox bacteria and canonical ammonia oxidizers under high N fertilization regimes	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												The response of complete ammonia-oxidizing (comammox) bacteria to variable nitrogen (N) inputs and nitrification inhibitors (NIs) remains poorly understood. We conducted two experiments, in a soil where both clade A and B comammox Nitrospira were present, to identify the type (ammonium sulphate vs. urea) and the level of Nfertilization (0-500 mg-N-kg-1d.w.-1 d.w. soil) that are conducive to the growth of comammox, compared to canonical ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOM), and subsequently to assess their response to three commercial (DCD, nitrapyrin, DMPP) and a new potent (ethoxyquin) NI under these favourable N fertilization regimes. The highest concentration of ammonium sulphate stimulated comammox compared to canonical AOM which showed a dose- dependent increase by both N sources. DMPP primarily, and DCD, imposed a more persistent inhibition on nitrification than nitrapyrin and ethoxyquin, a result which did not concur with the soil persistence of NIs (DMPP was the least persistent among the commercial NIs) but was mostly driven by their selective inhibitory activity on ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) that prevailed in the studied soil. The inhibition of AOB by DMPP and DCD was complemented by the proliferation of comammox and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). NIs induced significant changes on AOB and comammox communities. Comammox Nitrospira clade B were enriched by DCD and DMPP but depleted by nitrapyrin and ethoxyquin. We showed that (i) releasing comammox Nitrospira and AOA from AOB competition allows them to proliferate efficiently, even under high inorganic ammonium conditions; (ii) comammox clade B are more responsive than clade A to high inorganic N input and NIs.

For that purpose, detailed experimental (FT-IR, UV-vis , Zeta potential) and theoretical (density functional theory at B3LYP/6-311 ++ G(2d,2p) level) studies are conducted. Structural parameters (bond lengths and angles), net atomic charges and molecular electrostatic potential surfaces are analyzed at the same level of theory as well. Biological activity of the title compound towards Hep G2 liver cancer cells is established. Optimized molecular geometry, FT-IR and UV-vis studies revealed longer intramolecular interactions between coordination metal and selenate groups in NaFeSe. However, the latter is characterized with stronger bonds between the coordination metal and water molecules in comparison with NaCoSe. As a result, Co atom is in a higher oxidation state with respect to Fe. It is confirmed via UV-vis spectroscopy, where d-d transitions are registered in the electronic spectrum of NaCoSe. It was found that the NaFeSe (-23.45 mV) structure possesses a notably higher zeta potential than NaCoSe (-12.71 mV). Less compact structure and high zeta potential of NaFeSe were responsible for its better nonlinear optical behavior than Co-containing selenate. However, lower negatively charged NaCoSe particles influenced their more pronounced biological activity toward Hep G2 liver cancer cells. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Even though early prognosis and diagnosis are known to be indispensable for reaching an optimistic outcome, pathogenic complexities and the lack of specific treatment make it difficult to predict the outcome individually. In the present study, serum samples from surviving and non-surviving septic shock patients were drawn before clinical intervention at admission. Metabolic profiles of all the samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. One thousand four hundred nineteen peaks in positive mode and 1878 peaks in negative mode were retained with their relative standard deviation (RSD) below 30 %, in which 187 metabolites were initially identified by retention time and database in the light of the exact molecular mass. Differences between samples from the survivors and the non-survivors were investigated using multivariate and univariate analysis. Finally, 43 significantly varied metabolites were found in the comparison between survivors and non-survivors. Concretely, metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, amino acids, and several energy metabolism-related metabolites were up-regulated in the non-survivors, whereas those in the urea cycle and fatty acids were generally down-regulated. Metabolites such as lysine, alanine, and methionine did not present significant changes in the comparison. Six metabolites were further defined as primary discriminators differentiating the survivors from the non-survivors at the early stage of septic shock. Our findings reveal that LC-MS-based metabolomics is a useful tool for studying septic shock.

The CuO nanospheres possessed tunable pore features with comparatively higher value of a specific surface area (98.4 m2 g  1) and an excellent number of pores size 9.8-12.3 nm. As prepared catalysts exhibited excellent peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation ability for the treatment of highly toxic perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) from aqueous solution. Moreover, a systematic degradation approach was investigated by the study of various operating parameters such as PMS dose, catalyst dose, concentration of PFOA, initial pH, and temperature. Zeta potential measurement confirmed that PMS activation with ellipsoid CuO enhanced the availability of more active Lewis acid sites and show high chemical stability. About 92% PFOA degradation and 78% TOC reduction were achieved within 90 and 120 min respectively at optimum condition of initial pH= 7, catalyst dosage = 0.5 g L 1, PMSo= 0.5 mM, and temperature= 328 K for a solution of PFOAo= 10 mgL  1 by PMS/ellipsoid CuO system. Scavengers test analysis confirmed that singlet oxygen (1O2) is the most active species which effectively participated in the strong oxidative-reductive mechanism of PFOA degradation. In addition, a two-step pseudo-first-order kinetic model was well fitted, and very little metal leaching was observed via reusing after six cycles. GC-MS analysis was used for identification of the intermediates, a possible stepwise degradation pathway of long-chain perfluorosulphonic acids (PFACs) to shorter chain intermediates with the role of ellipsoid-CuO in PMS activation has been proposed.					singh, seema/AGU-5540-2022; Srivastava, Vimal/B-4455-2008; Kumar, Praveen/HHS-8246-2022; PATIDAR, RITESH/AAS-9786-2020; Singh, Dr Ajay/AAU-8384-2020; Kumar, Praveen/H-7626-2017	PATIDAR, RITESH/0000-0002-2831-8577; Kumar, Praveen/0000-0001-5847-1604; singh, seema/0000-0002-6985-6304														2352-4928				MAR	2023	34								105107	10.1016/j.mtcomm.2022.105107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mtcomm.2022.105107		DEC 2022											WOS:000991247400001

This work proposed a one-step thermal copolymerization to obtain Cu (I) doping porous carbon nitride (CUCN) through a spontaneously reducing atmosphere by urea in a covered crucible. The obtained CUCN had crumpled ultrathin nanosheets and mesoporous structures, which possessed higher specific surface areas than PCN. From X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) spectra analysis, the Cu doping existed in the oxidation state of Cu (I) as single atoms anchored on the 2D layers of CN through two N neighbors, thereby facilitating efficient pathways for the transfer of photoexcited charge carriers. Furthermore, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and transient photocurrent response test proved the improved separation and transfer of photoexcited charge carriers for Cu (I) introduction. Consequently, the photocatalytic activity of CUCN was much better than that of PCN for antibiotics norfloxacin (NOR), with 4.7-fold higher degradation reaction rate constants. From species-trapping experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations, the Cu single atoms in Cu-N2 served as catalytic sites that could accelerate charge transfer and facilitate the adsorption of molecular oxygen to produce active species. The stable Cu (I) embedded in the layer structure led to the excellent recycling test and remained stable after four runs of degradation and even thermal regenerated treatment. The degradation paths of NOR by CUCN under visible light were also demonstrated. Our work sheds light on a sustainable and practical approach for achieving stable metal single-atom doping and enhancing photocatalytic degradation of aqueous pollutants.

The as-prepared h-BNs were characterized using XRD, FESEM, FTIR, BET and XPS and the results indicated that the as-prepared h-BNs consist of microparticle structures with BET specific surface area between 12-18 m(2) g(-1). The h-BN prepared at 750 degrees C (BN-750) displayed excellent adsorption capacities for both Cu(II) and Ni(II) (up to 200 and 95 mg g(-1), respectively) compared to those prepared at other temperatures. At higher metal ion concentrations ( > 250 mg L-1), multilayer adsorption was observed. The equilibrium adsorption modelling study indicated that the adsorption process was best fitted to the Langmuir (R-2 > 0.97) and Sips (R-2 > 0.98) isotherm models. The binary adsorption of Cu(II) and Ni(II) was also investigated and the results revealed that the BN-750 has higher adsorption affinity for Cu(II) compared to Ni(II). Detailed analyses of the spent adsorbent using XPS and FTIR indicated that the oxygen functional groups of BN-750 played an important role in facilitating the electrostatic attraction and complexation of heavy metal during adsorption process. Furthermore, the results confirmed that Cu(II) and Ni(II) occupied the same active sites on BN-750. The results of this study revealed insights into the adsorption mechanism of Cu(II) and Ni(II) on BN-750 and demonstrated that the as-prepared h-BN is a promising adsorbent for efficient heavy metal removal in aqueous system.

This study aimed to alter the catalytic activity of biochar by using chemical amendments as an alternative to biomass feedstock screening. Three types of amendments including nonmetal elements (urea for N, sodium dodecyl sulfate for S), transition metal elements (MnSO4 for Mn, FeSO4 for Fe), and alkali/alkaline-earth metal elements (CaCl2 for Ca, NaCl for Na) were added to biomass substrate (peanut shell) before pyrolysis at 950 degrees C to produce 6 different chemically amended BCs. Structure, functional groups, sorption and redox properties of the BCs were characterized, and the catalytic reactivity of the BCs for trichloroethylene (TCE) reduction with a layered iron (II, III) hydroxide (green rust) as reductant was tested. Amending BC with transition metals increased the specific surface area (SSA) of BC and in turn the adsorption affinity, while nonmetals and alkali/alkaline-earth metal amendments decreased SSA. The TCE dechlorination rate increased by 3.5 and 2.5 times for BCs amended with N and S, respectively, compared with Raw-BC, while amendments with Mn, Fe, Ca, and Na had minor effects on reactivity. A second-order kinetic model for TCE reduction was developed, pointing out the critical role of the BC reactive site concentration and competing adsorption of TCE to inreactive surfaces. A conceptual model is proposed for TCE reaction with reactive sites and inreactive adsorptive surfaces on BC. This study suggested demonstrates that the reactive sites density is critical for BC catalytic reactivity, and N amendment is most efficient for improving BC reactivity.

Evaluation of potassium thiosulfate as a nitrification inhibitor to reduce nitrous oxide emissions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Potassium thiosulfate (KTS, K2S2O3) has been shown to function as a nitrification inhibitor, thus has the potential to reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and play an important role in effective N management. The objective of this research was to determine the potential effects of KTS on N2O emissions and N transformation processes in comparison with commercial N transformation inhibitors (stabilizers). A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted using urea and ammonium nitrate (UAN) applied at 150 mg N kg(-1) in a Hanford sandy loam soil (coarseloamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Typic Xerorthents). Treatments included three rates of KTS (26, 51, and 102 mg S2O32--S kg(-1)), a urease and nitrification inhibitor (Agrotain (R) Plus), a nitrification inhibitor (N-Serve (R) 24), and an untreated control. Nitrous oxide emission, soil pH, and mineral N species were monitored for 35 days. Total N2O emissions were reduced significantly by all KTS treatments as a function of KTS rate. At 102 mg S2O32 --S kg(-1), KTS reduced N2O emissions by 48% (0.18% of total inorganic N), which was statistically similar to the N-Serve (R) 24 treatment (60% reduction) although lower than Agrotain (R) Plus (78% reduction). The KTS resulted in significantly less unaccounted (total N) loss compared to the commercial inhibitors. If the N2O emissions reductions observed in this laboratory study are validated in the field, using KTS for this purpose can also provide a fertility benefit and may reduce total chemical inputs into agronomic systems. Future research needs to determine the effectiveness of thiosulfate for improving overall nutrient management while reducing N2O emissions under field conditions. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Tsai, CK; Huang, CH; Horng, JJ; Ong, HL; Doong, RA				Tsai, Cheng-Kuo; Huang, Ching-Hsuan; Horng, Jao-Jia; Ong, Hui Lin; Doong, Ruey-An			Enhanced Visible-Light-Responsive Photocatalytic Degradation of Ciprofloxacin by the CuxO/Metal-Organic Framework Hybrid Nanocomposite	NANOMATERIALS												Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is a commonly used antibiotic, however, once in the environment, it is highly toxic with a poor biodegradability. Given these attributes, an effective strategy for the removal of CIP is urgently needed for the protection of water resources. Herein, a novel copper metal-organic framework (CuxO/MOF) multifunctional material has been produced, in this work, by the calcination of Cu-MOF urea at 300 degrees C, in the presence of a 5% H-2 atmosphere. The morphological, structural, and thermal properties of the prepared CuxO/MOF were determined through various techniques, and its photocatalytic behavior was investigated for the degradation of CIP under visible-light irradiation. The prepared CuxO/MOF bifunctional material is presented as a graphitic carbon-layered structure with a particle size of 9.2 +/- 2.1 nm. The existence of CuO-Cu2O-C, which was found on the CuxO/MOF surface, enhanced the adsorption efficiency and increased the photosensitivity of CuxO/MOF, towards the degradation of CIP in aqueous solutions. The tailored CuxO/MOF, not only shows an excellent CIP degradation efficiency of up to 92% with a constant kinetic rate (k(obs)) of 0.048 min(-1) under visible light, but it can also retain the stable photodegradation efficiency of >85%, for at least six cycles. In addition, CuxO/MOF has an excellent adsorption capacity at pH 6.0 of the maximum Langmuir adsorption capacity of 34.5 mg g(-1) for CIP. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that CuxO/MOF is a reliable integrated material and serves as an adsorbent and photocatalyst, which can open a new pathway for the preparation of visible-light-responsive photocatalysts, for the removal of antibiotics and other emerging pollutants.

The photoelectrocatalytic properties of the prepared samples in the degradation of malachite green were examined under visible light. The phase composition, crystalline structure and optical properties of the La/N co-doped TiO2(Ni) photo-electrodes were studied using different measurement methods, including XRD, SEM, UV-vis DRS, Raman and FUR. The results indicated that the co-doped TiO2(Ni) photo-electrode not only effectively restrained the growth of the TiO2 grains, but also inhibited the transformation of the titania phase from anatase to rutile. The photo-response of the modified samples was substantially extended from 400 nm to 480 nm, and the band gap narrowed from 3.2 eV to 2.79 eV. The co-doped TiO2(Ni) samples exhibited higher photocatalytic activity as a result of the synergistic effects of the La and N co-doping. The degradation rate of malachite green by the La0.2%N20%/TiO2(Ni) photo-electrode was 23.5% higher than that of the un-doped sample; this result indicated that the extended range of responsive wavelengths greatly expanded the possible applications of the modified electrode. When a low bias voltage was applied to the La0.2%N20%/ TiO2(Ni) photo-electrodes, the electrodes exhibited even better photoelectrochemical properties and photoelectrocatalytic activity than a La0.2%N20%/TiO2(Ni) film under visible light irradiation.

J	Lee, S; Jeong, H; Chung, YM				Lee, Seungsun; Jeong, Hwiram; Chung, Young-Min			Direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide over Pd/C catalyst prepared by selective adsorption deposition method	JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS												A new catalyst design based on selective adsorption deposition method was developed to achieve high reaction performance in the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide. The activity of the unprecedented Pd/C catalyst was superior to that of the conventionally prepared Pd/C catalysts, and the initial H2O2 productivity and H-2 selectivity reached as high as 8606 mmol H2O2/g Pd.h and 95.1%, respectively. This excellent activity may result from the intrinsic structural and electronic features of the active sites, i.e., the extremely small and monodispersed Pd nanoparticles with a high Pd2+/Pd-0 ratio, which were realized by combining the selective adsorption of metal precursor cations on a negatively charged activated carbon surface and the subsequent homogeneous surface deposition of palladium hydroxide by the hydroxide ions that are slowly generated upon urea decomposition. The catalytic activity was significantly affected by the oxygen groups of the activated carbon support. The carboxyl groups do not efficiently suppress the unfavorable H-OOH dissociation but rather accelerate the H2O2 hydrolysis by forming hydrogen bonds with H2O2. Moreover, a sharp decrease in the reaction rates of H2O2 hydrogenation and direct synthesis of H2O2 was observed with the increase in the number of carboxyl groups on the activated carbon surface. This loss of activity, as confirmed by acid treatment and olefin hydrogenation experiments, implies that the carboxyl groups in close proximity to the active sites have a detrimental effect by hindering or poisoning the active sites.

Improved high temperature stability of anatase TiO2 photocatalysts by N, F, P co-doping	MATERIALS & DESIGN												Among the three commonly occurring phases (anatase, rutile, and brookite) of TiO2, the anatase form is reported to be the best photocatalyst due to the improved charge-carrier mobility and the greater number of surface hydroxyl groups. The anatase to rutile transition in titania photocatalysts usually occurs at a temperature between 500 degrees C to 700 degrees C. Development of a high temperature stable (above 1000 degrees C) anatase phase is important for various environmental applications (e.g. self-cleaning ceramic tiles, anti-microbial sanitary wares, etc.). In this study, the use of ammonium hexafluorophosphate as a single source dopant (method A) and urea, trifluoroacetic acid and phosphoric acid as multiple sources (method B) was undertaken to improving its high temperature stability. Method A was seen to produce a more stable anatase phase, with 68% anatase present at 1100 degrees C, compared to method B which showed 100% rutile at 900 degrees C. Kinetic analysis shows a marked increase in the photocatalytic degradation of a model dye using materials calcined at 1100 degrees C for method A (0.042 min(-1)) compared to that for method B (0.005 min(-1)) and the commercial photocatalyst Evonik-Degussa AEROXIDE (R) (0.031 min(-1)) at 1100 degrees C. XPS results showed that, the only dopant detected at high temperatures is phosphorus in its P5+ form. The incorporation of phosphorus has proved to be an effective method in stabilising the anatase phase at high temperature. The current investigation also showed that a single source precursor is more favourable to obtain high temperature stable anatase phase photocatalysts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study utilized hydrothermal conditions and established the role of precipitating agents (urea, N-methylurea and N,N'-dimethylurea) on properties and catalytic activity of Fe2O3-Al2O3 catalysts (Fe-u, Fe-mu and Fe-dmu, respectively). The precipitating agent played a key role in tailoring the properties, such as crystallization degree, surface area and reducibility. The precipitating agents influenced the yield and outer diameters of MWCNTs but did not affect graphitization degree. Among the synthesized catalysts, Fe-u had the largest surface area and preferential formation of the highly reducible alpha-Fe2O3 crystalline phase. As a result, Fe-u had the highest activity during conversion of pyrolysis gas from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into MWCNTs, yielding 0.91 g.g(-1)-catalyst MWCNTs at 800 C as compared to 0.42 and 0.14 g.g(-1) catalyst using Fe-dmu and Fe-mu, respectively. Fe-dmu favored the growth of MWCNTs with smaller outer diameters. Fe-u demonstrated high efficiency during operation using a continuous flow of pyrolysis gas from a mixture of polyolefins (70 wt% polypropylene, 6 wt% LDPE and 24 wt% high density polyethylene) producing 4.28 g.g(-1)-catalyst MWCNTs at 3.2% plastic conversion efficiency and a stable H-2 flow for 155 min (25-32 vol %). The obtained data demonstrate that the selection of an appropriate precipitating agent for hydrothermal synthesis allows for the production of highly active Fe2O3-Al2O3 catalysts for the upcycling of polyolefin plastic waste into MWCNTs and H-2.

Many previously published studies about deNO(x) technology are based on selective catalytic reduction (SCR), but only few deal with inner selective non-catalytic reduction (inner SNCR) technology, which is an intensive improvement of selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) applied in the in-cylinder purification procedure. Before numerical calculations were carried out, the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation model was validated with steady-state experimental results. The main results revealed that with the increasing concentration of aqueous solution of ammonia, nitrogen oxides gradually decrease, and the largest decline of NOx is 65.1% with little loss of cylinder peak pressure. Unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) and carbon monoxide (CO) may increase using inner SNCR, and soot emissions show a decreased tendency. However, there is little change when ammonia content varies. Ulteriorly, refining the direct injection phase is of great help to inner SNCR technology to enhance the reduction of NOx and reduce NH3 oxidation and NH3 slipping.

In situ XPS study of the size effect in the interaction of NO with the surface of the model Ag/Al2O3/FeCrAl catalysts	RUSSIAN CHEMICAL BULLETIN												The interaction of NO with the surface of model Ag/Al2O3/FeCrAl catalysts containing Ag nanoparticles of different size (1 and 3 nm) was studied. The use of the Auger parameter alpha(Ag) (E (b)(Ag3d(5/2)) + E (kin)(Ag MVV)) made it possible to reliably identify the change in the chemical state of silver cluster upon their interaction with D-2 and NO. The oxygen treatment leads to the oxidation of small Ag nanoparticles (1 nm) and formation of AgO (x) clusters resulted in the intensive formation of nitrite-nitrate structures on the step of the interaction with NO. These structures are localized on both the silver clusters and Al2O3 surface. An increase in the size of Ag-0 nanoparticles to 3 nm results in an increase in the stability of these structures and impedes the Ag-0 -> AgO (x) transition, due to which the formation of surface groups NO2 (-)/NO3 (-) is suppressed. The data obtained make it possible to explain the dependence of the activity of the Ag/Al2O3 catalysts in the selective reduction of NO on the Ag nanoparticle size.

In this study, two kinds of poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL)-based biodegradable TPUs were synthesized using either DL-dithiothreitol (DTE) or glycerol as chain extenders. The reactive side groups on the chain extenders provide uniformly spaced post-crosslinking sites that can be bridged by thiol oxidation for DTE and by diisocyanate grafting for glycerol, thus leading to lightly crosslinked TPUs that can still be easily processed. The chemical structure, thermal properties, mechanical performance, and degradation behaviour of these TPUs were studied comprehensively. Their chemical structures were verified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The post-crosslinldng hindered the crystallization of the PCL region and significantly enhanced the thermal decomposition temperature. Post-crosslinked TPUs achieved significant improvements in modulus, ultimate strength, flexibility, and tear resistance compared to their neat counterparts. The degradation rate was found to correlate with material wettability, and the formation of chemical crosslinks reduced the hydrolytic degradation rate of TPUs. In summary, by introducing functional groups via chain extenders and post-crosslinking, biodegradable TPUs with improved and tuneable properties and suitable for various applications could be obtained.

Organic Synthesis Away from Equilibrium: Contrathermodynamic Transformations Enabled by Excited-State Electron Transfer	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH												Conspectus: Chemists have long been inspired by biological photosynthesis, wherein a series of excited-state electron transfer (ET) events facilitate the conversion of low energy starting materials such as H2O and CO2 into higher energy products in the form of carbohydrates and O-2. While this model for utilizing light-driven charge transfer to drive catalytic reactions thermodynamically "uphill" has been extensively adapted for small molecule activation, molecular machines, photoswitches, and solar fuel chemistry, its application in organic synthesis has been less systematically developed. However, the potential benefits of these approaches are significant, both in enabling transformations that cannot be readily achieved using conventional thermal chemistry and in accessing distinct selectivity regimes that are uniquely enabled by excited-state mechanisms. In this Account, we present work from our group that highlights the ability of visible light photoredox catalysis to drive useful organic transformations away from their equilibrium positions, addressing a number of long-standing synthetic challenges. We first discuss how excited-state ET enabled the first general methods for the catalytic anti-Markovnikov hydroamination of unactivated alkenes with alkyl amines. In these reactions, an excited-state iridium(III) photocatalyst reversibly oxidizes secondary amine substrates to their corresponding aminium radical cations (ARCs). These electrophilic N-centered radicals can then react with olefins to furnish valuable tertiary amine products with complete anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity. Notably, some of these products are less thermodynamically stable than their corresponding amine and alkene starting materials. We next present a strategy for light-driven C-C bond cleavage within various aliphatic alcohols mediated by homolytic activation of alcohol O-H bonds by excited-state proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). The resulting alkoxy radical intermediates then undergo C-C beta-scission to ultimately provide isomeric linear carbonyl products that are often higher in energy than their cyclic alcohol precursors. Applications of this chemistry for the light-driven depolymerization of lignin biomass, commercial phenoxy resin, hydroxylated polyolefin derivatives, and thermoset polymers are presented as well. We then describe a method for the contrathermodynamic positional isomerization of highly substituted olefins by means of cooperative photoredox and chromium(II) catalysis. In this work, generation of an allylchromium(III) species that can undergo highly regioselective in situ protodemetalation enables access to a less substituted and thermodynamically less stable positional isomer. Product selectivity in this reaction is determined by the large differential in oxidation potentials between differently substituted olefin isomers. Lastly, we discuss a light-driven deracemization reaction developed in collaboration with the Miller group, wherein a racemic urea substrate undergoes spontaneous optical enrichment upon visible light irradiation in the presence of an iridium(III) chromophore, a chiral Br & oslash;nsted base, and a chiral peptide thiol. Excellent levels of enantioselectivity are achieved via sequential and synergistic proton transfer (PT) and H atom transfer (HAT) steps. Taken together, these examples highlight the ability of excited-state ET events to enable access to nonequilibrium product distributions across a wide range of catalytic, redox-neutral transformations in which photons are the only stoichiometric reagents.

Effects of dietary rumen-protected choline supplementation to periparturient dairy cattle on inflammation, metabolism, and performance during an intramammary lipopolysaccharide challenge	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE												Recent studies have suggested that dietary rumen protected choline (RPC) supplementation can modulate immune function, attenuate inflammation, and improve performance in periparturient dairy cattle; however, this has yet to be evaluated during a mastitis challenge. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the effects of supplementation and dose of RPC on metabolism, inflammation, and performance during an intramammary lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Parous Holstein cows (parity, mean +/- SD, 1.9 +/- 1.1 at enrollment) were blocked by calving month and randomly assigned within block to receive either 45 g/d of RPC (20.4 g/d of choline ions; CHOL45, n = 18), 30 g/d of RPC (13.6 g/d of choline ions; CHOL30, n = 21), or no RPC (CON, n = 19) as a top-dress starting 24 d before expected calving until 21 d postpartum. Cows were alternately assigned within treatment group to either receive an intramammary LPS challenge (200 mu g in each rear quarter; Escherichia coli O111:B4) or not at 17 DIM. Before the challenge, CHOL45 and CHOL30 cows produced 3.4 and 3.8 (+/- 1.2 SED) kg/d more milk than CON, respectively. Dietary RPC supplementation did not mitigate the milk loss associated with the intramammary LPS challenge; however, CHOL45 and CHOL30 cows produced 3.1 and 3.5 (+/- 1.4 SED) kg/d more milk than CON, respectively in the carryover period (22 to 84 DIM). Dietary RPC supplementation enhanced plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations before the LPS challenge, and increased plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and acetylcarnitine concentrations during the LPS challenge, potentially reflecting greater adipose tissue mobilization, fatty acid transport and oxidation. Aside from trimethylamine N-oxide and sarcosine, which were increased in CHOL45-LPS as compared with CON-LPS, most other choline metabolite concentrations in plasma were unaffected by treatment, likely because more choline was being secreted in milk. Plasma lactic acid concentrations were decreased in CHOL45-LPS and CHOL30-LPS as compared with CON-LPS, suggesting a reduction in glycolysis or an enhancement in the flux through the lactic acid cycle to support gluconeogenesis. Plasma concentrations of fumaric acid, a byproduct of AA catabolism and the urea cycle, were increased in both choline groups as compared with CON-LPS during the LPS challenge. Cows in the CHOL45 group had greater plasma antioxidant potential before the LPS challenge and reduced plasma methionine sulfoxide concentrations during the LPS challenge compared with CON-LPS, suggesting an improvement in oxidant status. Nevertheless, concentrations of inflammatory markers such as haptoglobin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) were not affected by treatment. Taken together, our data suggest that the effects of dietary RPC supplementation on milk yield could be mediated through metabolic pathways and are unlikely to be related to the resolution of inflammation in periparturient dairy cattle. Lastly, dose responses to dietary RPC supplementation were not found for various economically important outcomes including milk yield, limiting the justification for feeding a greater dietary RPC dose in industry.

In addition, the liver and intestinal morphology were protected after supplementing VD3. This is a research basis for the application of VD3 as a feed additive in poultry against oxidative stress. Vitamin D-3 (VD3) is an indispensable micronutrient in livestock and poultry feed. Its function in antioxidant stress has been reported. We investigate whether the addition of different concentrations of VD3 to the diet affects the production performance, slaughter performance, meat quality, organ index, and gut injury on the diquat (DQ)-induced model of oxidative stress in Wenchang chickens. Four hundred and eighty one-day-old chickens were randomly divided into six groups: control (basal diet), 4000 VD (basal diet + VD3 4000 IU per kg feed intake), 1000 VD+DI (DQ, basal diet + VD3 1000 IU per kg feed intake), 2000 VD+DI (DQ, basal diet + VD3 2000 IU per kg feed intake), and 4000 VD+DI (DQ, basal diet + VD3 4000 IU per kg feed intake). The results showed that the addition of VD3 to the diet promoted DQ-induced weight loss and reduced ADFI, slaughter rate, splenic index, and pH after 1 h and 24 h in the leg muscles. VD3 decreased the increase in content of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) among proinflammatory cytokines (p < 0.05) and increased the reduction in anti-inflammatory cytokines content of interleukin-10 (IL-10) (p < 0.05) induced by DQ. In addition, liver and kidney injury biomarkers and the intestinal permeability index in serum were disordered after treatment with DQ (p < 0.05). VD3 perfected the increase of D-lactic acid (D-LA), diamine oxidase (DAO), total cholesterol (T-CHO), creatinine (CR), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) content, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity (p < 0.05); it increased the decrease of albumin (ALB) content (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, VD3 regulated the intestinal morphology and intestinal barrier. Moreover, DQ induced a decrease in total antioxidant capacity and antioxidant enzyme activity in the serum, liver, and jejunum (p < 0.05), and an increase in malonaldehyde (MDA) content (p < 0.05). However, the addition of different levels of VD3 could alleviate the above phenomenon of oxidative stress in Wenchang chickens to different degrees. Thus, this research suggested that the addition of VD3 can relieve the DQ-induced oxidative stress of Wenchang chickens, and the level of VD3 acquisition is positively correlated with the remission effect.

Persistence of Sarcopenia After Pediatric Liver Transplantation Is Associated With Poorer Growth and Recurrent Hospital Admissions	JOURNAL OF PARENTERAL AND ENTERAL NUTRITION												IntroductionSarcopenia is prevalent in adults pre-liver transplantation (LTx) and post-LTx contributing to adverse outcomes. Little is known regarding the prevalence of sarcopenia in pediatric LTx recipients. This novel study examined sarcopenia prevalence and associations with post-LTx growth and healthcare utilization in pediatric LTx recipients. MethodsWe prospectively assessed body composition at annual clinical appointments in children (0.5-17 years; n = 58) by Dual-energy-X-ray absorptiometry (absolute/regional/percent fat mass [FM], fat-free mass [FFM], skeletal muscle mass [SMM]). Sarcopenia was defined as SMM z scores 2. Additional variables measured included age, gender, PELD, immunosuppressive therapies (dose/type), weight, weight-z, height, height-z, serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, -glutamyltransferase, albumin, total/conjugated bilirubin, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, albumin, creatinine clearance, urea and creatinine at LTx assessment, LTx and annual clinic appointments. Healthcare variables studied included rejection (number/type/severity), length of in-patient stay (total, intensive care unit [ICU], emergency, readmission) and ventilator dependency. ResultsSarcopenia occurred in 41% (n = 17) at 7.6 ( 3.1) years; with a mean time post-LTx of 1.1 +/- 1.9 (1-8) years. Female children 9.8 years had a higher sarcopenia prevalence than children >9.8 years (83.1% vs 17.1%; p = 0.004). Sarcopenia was associated with lower weight velocity standard deviation scores, lower weight-z/height-z scores at 2-10 years post LTx, increased hospitalization (total, ICU, emergency and readmission) and ventilator dependency (p < 0.05), but not to rejection and/or corticosteroid therapy (p > 0.05). ConclusionsThis is the first study demonstrating persistent sarcopenia associated with poorer growth and recurrent hospitalization in children post-LTx.						, Susan/0000-0003-2432-1549													0148-6071	1941-2444				FEB	2019	43	2					271	280		10.1002/jpen.1414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpen.1414								30035306					WOS:000458699000010

While utilizing them at elevated temperatures is highly desirable, their operating temperature is usually kept below 300 degrees C to prevent isolated atoms from agglomerating. Moreover, their applications in high-temperature electrochemical devices have been hindered by the lack of suitable processing techniques for catalyst loading. Herein, we report single-atom Pt/ceria nanocatalysts that are highly active and thermally stable in solid oxide cells (SOCs) operating at 600-800 degrees C. Our urea-based chemical solution process creates strong Pt-O-Ce interactions that securely anchor isolated Pt atoms to the surface of ceria nanoparticles and suppress their high-temperature migration. These single-atom Pt/ceria nanocatalysts are loaded in the oxide fuel electrode of a SOC via an in situ synthetic process, which reduces the polarization resistance from 28.2 to 0.82 Ohm cm(2) at 600 degrees C. This electrode outperforms the state-of-the-art Ni-based fuel electrode by up to 10 times and delivers extremely high performance in full SOCs in fuel cell and electrolysis modes. Furthermore, it stably operates at 700 degrees C for over 500 h under realistic operating conditions. Our results provide guidance to resolve the critical issues for the practical use of single-atom catalysts in various industrial processes and accelerate the commercial development of next-generation high-temperature energy devices.

Hepatic glucagon action: beyond glucose mobilization	PHYSIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												Glucagon's ability to promote hepatic glucose production has been known for over a century, with initial observations touting this hormone as a diabetogenic agent. However, glucagon receptor agonism [when balanced with an incretin, including glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) to dampen glucose excursions] is now being developed as a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of metabolic diseases, like metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic disease/metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASLD/MASH), and may also have benefit for obesity and chronic kidney disease. Conventionally regarded as the opposing tag-team partner of the anabolic mediator insulin, glucagon is gradually emerging as more than just a "catabolic hormone." Glucagon action on glucose homeostasis within the liver has been well characterized. However, growing evidence, in part thanks to new and sensitive "omics" technologies, has implicated glucagon as more than just a "glucose liberator." Elucidation of glucagon's capacity to increase fatty acid oxidation while attenuating endogenous lipid synthesis speaks to the dichotomous nature of the hormone. Furthermore, glucagon action is not limited to just glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism, as traditionally reported. Glucagon plays key regulatory roles in hepatic amino acid and ketone body metabolism, as well as mitochondrial turnover and function, indicating broader glucagon signaling consequences for metabolic homeostasis mediated by the liver. Here we examine the broadening role of glucagon signaling within the hepatocyte and question the current dogma, to appreciate glucagon as more than just that "catabolic hormone."

In this work, we report the morphology-controllable synthesis of zinc cobalt mixed sulfide (Zn-Co-S) nanoarchitectures, including nanosheets, nanoplates, and nanoneedles, grown on conductive carbon fiber paper (CFP) and the micronanostructure dependent electrochemical efficacy for catalyzing hydrogen and oxygen in zinc-air batteries and water electrolysis. The formation of different Zn-Co-S morphologies was attributed to the synergistic effect of decomposed urea products and the corrosion of NH4F. Among synthesized Zn-Co-S nanostructures, the nanoneedle arrays supported on CFP exhibit superior trifunctional activity for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution reactions than its nanosheet and nanoplate counterparts through half reaction testing. It also exhibited better catalytic durability than Pt/C and RuO2. Furthermore, the Zn-Co-S nanoneedle/ CFP electrode enables rechargeable Zn-air batteries with low overpotential (0.85 V), high efficiency (58.1%), and long cycling lifetimes (200 cycles) at 10 mA cm(-2) as well as considerable performance for water splitting. The superior performance is contributed to the integrated nanoneedle/CFP nanostructure, which not only provides enhanced electrochemical active area, but also facilitates ion and gas transfer between the catalyst surface and electrolyte, thus maintaining an effective solid-liquid-gas interface necessary for electrocatalysis. These results indicate that the Zn-Co-S nanoneedle/CFP system is a low cost, highly active, and durable electrode for highly efficient rechargeable zinc-air batteries and water electrolysis in alkaline solution.

J	Chen, H; Jiang, DE; Yang, ZZ; Dai, S				Chen, Hao; Jiang, De-en; Yang, Zhenzhen; Dai, Sheng			Engineering Nanostructured Interfaces of Hexagonal Boron Nitride- Based Materials for Enhanced Catalysis	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH												CONSPECTUS: Hexagonal boron nitrides (h-BNs) are attractive two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials that consist of alternating B and N atoms and layered honeycomb-like structures similar to graphene. They have exhibited unique properties and promising application potentials in the field of energy storage and transformation. Recent advances in utilizing h-BN as a metal-free catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane have triggered broad interests in exploring h-BN in catalysis. However, h-BN-based materials as robust nanocatalysts in heterogeneous catalysis are still underexplored because of the limited methodologies capable of affording h-BN with controllable crystallinity, abundant porosity, high purity, and defect engineering, which played important roles in tuning their catalytic performance. In this Account, our recent progress in addressing the above issues will be highlighted, including the synthesis of high-quality h-BN-based nanomaterials via both bottom-up and top-down pathways and their catalytic utilization as metal-free catalysts or as supports to tune the interfacial electronic properties on the metal nanoparticles (NPs). First, we will focus on the large-scale fabrication of h-BN nanosheets (h-BNNSs) with high crystallinity, improved surface area, satisfactory purity, and tunable defects. h-BN derived from the traditional approaches using boron trioxide and urea as the starting materials generally contains carbon/oxygen impurities and has low crystallinity. Several new strategies were developed to address the issues. Using bulk h-BN as the precursor via gas exfoliation in liquid nitrogen, single-or few-layered h-BNNS with abundant defects could be generated. Amorphous h-BN precursors could be converted to h-BN nanosheets with high crystallinity assisted by a magnesium metallic flux via a successive dissolution/precipitation/crystallization procedure. The as-fabricated h-BNNS featured high crystallinity and purity as well as abundant porosity. An ionothermal metathesis procedure was developed using inorganic molten salts (NaNH2 and NaBH4) as the precursors. The h-BN scaffolds could be produced on a large scale with high yield, and the as-afforded materials possessed high purity and crystallinity. Second, utilization of the as-prepared h-BN library as metal-free catalysts in dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions will be summarized, in which they exhibited enhanced catalytic activity over the counterparts from the previous synthesis method. Third, the interface modulation between metal NPs with the as-prepared defects' abundant h-BN support will be highlighted. The h-BN-based strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) nanocatalysts were constructed without involving reducible metal oxides via the ionothermal procedure we developed by deploying specific inorganic metal salts, acting as robust nanocatalysts in CO oxidation.

Nitrosopumilus adriaticus sp. nov. and Nitrosopumilus piranensis sp. nov., two ammonia-oxidizing archaea from the Adriatic Sea and members of the class Nitrososphaeria	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY												Two mesophilic, neutrophilic and aerobic marine ammonia-oxidizing archaea, designated strains NF5(T) and D3C(T), were isolated from coastal surface water of the Northern Adriatic Sea. Cells were straight small rods 0.20-0.25 mu m wide and 0.49-2.00 mu m long. Strain NF5(T) possessed archaella as cell appendages. Glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers with zero to four cyclopentane moieties (GDGT-0 to GDGT-4) and crenarchaeol were the major core lipids. Menaquinone MK6:0 was the major respiratory quinone. Both isolates gained energy by oxidizing ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (NO2-) and used bicarbonate as a carbon source. Strain D3C(T) was able use urea as a source of ammonia for energy production and growth. Addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavengers (catalase or alpha-keto acids) was required to sustain growth. Optimal growth occurred between 30 and 32 degrees C, pH 7.1 and 7.3 and between 34 and 37 parts per thousand salinity. The cellular metal abundance ranking of both strains was Fe>Zn>Cu>Mn>Co. The genomes of strains NF5(T) and D3C(T) have a DNA G+C content of 33.4 and 33.8 mol%, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that both strains are affiliated with the class Nitrososphaeria, sharing similar to 85 % 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with Nitrososphaera viennensis EN76(T). The two isolates are separated by phenotypic and genotypic characteristics and are assigned to distinct species within the genus Nitrosopumilus gen. nov. according to average nucleotide identity thresholds of their closed genomes. Isolates NF5(T) (=JCM 32270(T) =NCIMB 15114(T)) and D3C(T) (=JCM 32271(T) = DSM 106147(T) =NCIMB 15115(T)) are type strains of the species Nitrosopumilus adriaticus sp. nov. and Nitrosopumilus piranensis sp. nov., respectively.

The as-prepared catalysts were characterized by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning and Transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), Nitrogen-physisorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Temperature programmed reduction analyses. The iron was found in the form of hematite and metallic-iron in the fresh and reduced catalysts respectively. A suitable metal-support interaction due to the fine surface dispersion of iron species on ZrO2 was observed in the catalysts. The N-2-physisorption analysis indicated the reduced surface area of the catalysts after iron loading. However, it does not influence the catalytic efficiency since the metal amount and metal-support interaction was determined to play the main role. The Fe/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited improved catalytic efficiency. With increasing the amount of iron and increasing the reaction temperature, the CH4 and CO2 conversions were increased significantly. A highest CH4 and CO2 conversions of 92% and 89% respectively, with an H-2/CO ratio of similar to 2.25 were obtained for the 50%Fe/ZrO2 catalyst at 900 degrees C. The enhanced catalytic performance could be attributed to the fine-surface dispersion of iron-nanocrystals on ZrO2 . Moreover, the MWCNTs were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and Raman analyses for their structural properties. (C) 2020 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

J	Abdel-Gayoum, AA; Ahmida, MHS				Abdel-Gayoum, Abdelgayoum Ahmed; Ahmida, Mohamed Hamza Sulaiman			Changes in the serum, liver, and renal cortical lipids and electrolytes in rabbits with cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity	TURKISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES												Background/aim: Cisplatin is an anticancer drug that can induce nephrotoxicity. Its toxicity is associated with dyslipidemia and disturbed electrolyte balance. In the present study we investigated the changes in serum lipid profile and electrolyte levels and their contents in kidney and liver tissues of rabbits treated with cisplatin. Materials and methods: Twenty-eight adult male New Zealand White rabbits were used in the experiment. Animals of groups C, P1, and P2 were injected with saline, cisplatin (4.0 mg/kg bw), and cisplatin (6.5 mg/kg bw), respectively, and killed 3 days after the injections. Animals of group R were given cisplatin (6.5 mg/kg bw) and killed after 7 days. All animals were killed after an overnight fast. Results: The P2 animals showed reductions in their body weights, significant (P < 0.001) increases in serum creatinine and urea levels, and significant (P < 0.001) drops in cortical alkaline phosphatase activity and necrotic kidney histology. The treatments had no effect on liver function. Moreover, the P2 animals showed increased serum cholesterol, TAG, and elevated LDL-cholesterol, with significant accumulations of the kidney cholesterol and TAG, but no change in serum phospholipid and depleted hepatic cholesterol. Moreover, the P2 animals had depressed serum levels of potassium, calcium, and magnesium, and reduced renal cortical calcium and magnesium contents and depressed liver calcium but not magnesium. However, the P1 animals had no significant alterations in their lipid or electrolyte levels. Most of the perturbed parameters returned to normal levels in the recovery group. Conclusion: Cisplatin nephrotoxicity in rabbits is accompanied by reductions in body weight, secondary dyslipidemia, and reduced serum potassium, calcium, and magnesium with depleted renal cortical magnesium and calcium and accumulated cortical lipids.																			1300-0144	1303-6165					2017	47	3					1019	1027		10.3906/sag-1602-136	http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/sag-1602-136								28618760					WOS:000404381800045

Following the batch equilibrium method, the K-OC (as log values) ranged from 1.2 to 3.9 (thiametoxam and pirimicarb, respectively). All the insecticides were moderately persistent (t(1/2) = 39-100 days) in the following order: thiametoxam > imidacloprid > pirimicarb > chlorantraniliprole. Two major transformation products, desmethyl-formamido pirimicarb and desmethyl pirimicarb, were formed as consequence of dealkylation of the parent compound. Using disturbed soil columns only thiametoxam (93% of the initial amount) and imidacloprid (42% of the initial amount) were recovered from leachates. In the case of pirimicarb and chlorantraniliprole, 74% and 30%, respectively, were recovered from the soil. Thiametoxam and imidacloprid can be catalogued as mobile compounds, while pirimicarb and chlorantraniliprole are classified as immobile according to the screening indices used (GUS and ELI). Leachates containing thiametoxam and imidacloprid were subjected to photocatalytic treatment for 240 min using TiO2/Na2S2O8 with the help of a photochemical reactor equipped with LED lamp. Both compounds had a very fast degradation rate (half-lives <= 0.5 min) in deionized water, while their half-lives were 112 min and 178 min, respectively, in leaching water. This implies a strong effect of the water matrix composition, mainly due to organic matter dissolved (quenching). Only traces of thiametoxam urea and hydroxy imidacloprid were detected during the photocatalytic experiment. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For the extraction of valuable phenolics from sunflower pomace, nine potential NADES were prepared. Among them, choline chloride-urea-water (CC-U-W) at a molar ratio of 1:2:4 was selected for extraction, showing better yield and physicochemical properties. Operational parameters (extraction temperature, time, water ratio, and solvent-to-solid ratio) for MAE were optimized and modeled utilizing response surface methodology. Under optimal conditions, the antioxidant properties of SFP extract were evaluated by CUPRAC, ABTS, and DPPH methods. The total phenolic contents of extracts were evaluated by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Phenolics were characterized by using the HPLC-PDA system. The results showed that SFP NADES extract had potential antioxidant activity which was higher than that of traditional solvents. In order to better evaluate SFP extract as a valuable food ingredient, SFP extracts at a ratio of 5, 10, and 20% added smoothie-like beverages with strawberries and yogurt were prepared. Fortification of beverages with NADES extract enhanced antioxidant efficiency, increasing total antioxidant capacity in a range of 12.4 to 68.6% and free radical scavenging capacity between 0.4 to 67.9% during both the initial and the in vitro gastrointestinal digestion stages. The addition of SFP NADES extract to food samples made a positive contribution in terms of the antioxidant activity of the final product. The results of this study revealed that sunflower by-products can be evaluated as a potential antioxidant source which is easily accessible, and the proposed extraction process has an important potential to recover bioactive compounds with high efficiency.

J	Huang, HD; Liu, CY; Zhang, LQ; Zhong, GJ; Li, ZM				Huang, Hua-Dong; Liu, Chun-Yan; Zhang, Liang-Qing; Zhong, Gan-Ji; Li, Zhong-Ming			Simultaneous Reinforcement and Toughening of Carbon Nanotube/Cellulose Conductive Nanocomposite Films by Interfacial Hydrogen Bonding	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING												Carbon nanotube (CNT)/cellulose nanocomposite films were prepared by a featured processing method, i.e., solution dispersion, slow gelation and hot-press drying, where an environmentally benign processing solvent (sodium hydroxide/urea aqueous solution) was used. The scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated uniform CNT dispersion in the cellulose. The slow gelation and hot-press drying could effectively reduce the free volume and force the cellulose chains and CNTs to contact as close as possible, thus forming the strong interfacial hydrogen bonding between the residual oxygen-containing functional groups on the CNT surfaces and the hydroxyl groups in the cellulose chains, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy results. As a result, with a CNT loading of 5 wt %, the tensile strength and Youngs modulus of the cellulose nanocomposite films were increased by 55% and 21% relative to neat cellulose film. More interestingly, the tensile toughness reached 5.8 MJ/m(3), about 346% higher than that of neat cellulose film. This simultaneous reinforcement and toughening of cellulose by only incorporating the pristine CNTs has been rarely reported. The reason could be explained in the terms of the fortified interfacial hydrogen bonding, which not only facilitated the stress transfer in the interfacial region but also reduced the density of hydrogen bonding network in the intra- and intermolecular chains of cellulose so as to enhance the plastic deformation of the cellulose nanocomposite films significantly. In addition, a good conductivity of 7.2 S.m(-1) was achieved with a percolation threshold of as low as 0.71 vol %. The strategy proposed here is simple, low cost, efficient and green, exhibiting great potential for fabricating high-performance and multifunctional CNT/cellulose nanocomposite films used in the realms of antistatic packages, electromagnetic shielding, electrodes, sensors and electric smart brands.

Of the several factors involved in planarization, the choice of abrasive slurries affects the extent to which impurities and roughness are removed. Cerium oxide (CeO2) is considered an outstanding polishing material because of its excellent hardness, well-controlled structure, and chemical force, and CMP requires well-dispersed slurry nanoparticles (NPs) with uniform structure, size, and shape. In this study, urea/alkaline-induced nanocubic Methods: CeO2 was synthesized in the presence of cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)generated cubic CeO2 NPs, which were then used in a silica wafer polishing test. Dynamic laser scattering and transmission electron microscopy indicated that the cubic plate NP size distribution and zeta potential ranged from 18 to 30 nm when measured between -35 and -45 mV. Elemental composition via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was studied to demonstrate the mechanism of Ce3+/Ce4+ with crystal information, which matched the X-ray diffraction grain size calculation and finite element-scanning electron microscopy measurements. We also performed a simulation of cubic CeO2 NP formation and pillar CeO2 inhibition under an additional amount of structure-modifying agent (e.g., CTAB). Fourier transform infrared spectra indicated a successful CTAB reaction with CeO2. Small angle X-ray scattering spectra were used to obtain simulated NP shapes and parameters via the SasView model. A confocal laser scanning microscope was then used to measure the roughness and 2-D plane view of an 8-inch tetraethyl orthosilicate coated silica wafer. Significant findings: Our results showed that the bared silica wafer planarize with CTABx-CeO2 NPs reduced the ISO grade number from Level 9 to Level 7, which corresponds to a 70.7-74.5% roughness planarization of the raw material. This study presents a fast, uniform, low-roughness CMP slurry material synthesis and characterization method that can enhance the technique of slurry nanoparticle synthesis from stable materials.

Nickel was accumulated by complex formation between Ni (II) in solution and amines sites in the polymer backbone to obtain Ni-MWCNT-PT/G (graphite) electrode. Surface morphology of composite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The reflectance and transmittance amplitudes were obtained, using the continuity of the tangential components of electrical and magnetic fields at interfaces and solving the algebraic matrix equation. Furthermore, the experimental absorbance spectra of nanocomposite were compared with the results from the Maxwell-Garnett theory (MGT) and the value of energy, E-g = 3.75 eV, of composite obtained. The electrochemical performance of Ni-MWCNT-PT/G composite electrodes were investigated by common electrochemical techniques.

Herein, we have designed and synthesized a new 3D flower-like p-n-p heterostructure fl-Ni(OH)2/NiS/TiO2 as a photocatalytic device, which is ideally suited for both removal of anionic dye methyl orange (MO), and release of hydrogen from the MO solution driven by photoelectric conversion without the need for using noble metals. The formation structure with optimal molar ratio 0.01-fl-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 shows superior photocatalytic activity for removal of anionic dye MO and releasing hydrogen, its removal efficiency can reach as high as 98% in 15 min and the production of hydrogen is about 7.2 mu molh-1 from the MO solution. Results and analyses show that the outstanding performances of the sample should be attributed to the synergistic effects on two aspects. One is the high efficient charge separation and transfer driven by the internal electric field at the interfaces of NiS/TiO2 and the exposed high energy {001} facets of TiO2. The other is the modifier fl-Ni(OH)2 as an assistant sacrificial agent can play an important role of the holes transfer for charge carriers transport balance in the oxidation-reduction process, and the generated active species NiOOH also has a beneficial effect on degrading MO and releasing hydrogen.

Improvements in the production of wood fiber insulation boards using hot-air/hot-steam process	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOOD AND WOOD PRODUCTS												In times of climate change and shortage of non-renewable resources, building insulation becomes an important issue to save energy and resources. One option could be to use wood fiber insulation boards as a substitute for fossil fuel-based insulation materials. This document presents the manufacturing of wood fiber insulation boards by using the dry process and an innovative curing method combining hot-air and hot-steam. The aim was to reveal the positive physical effects of using hot air and steam in combination for curing of pressure-resistant insulation wood fiber boards. In addition to familiar bonding agents such as polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (pMDI), urea-formaldehyde resin (UF) and an enzymatic binder system should be partially used here for substitution. At this stage, fibers should be enzymatically pre-treated with laccase in conjunction with a suitable mediator, forming a Laccase-Mediator-System (LMS). A further goal of the paper is to investigate in which quantities LMSs can be added to the binder mixture to achieve results comparable to those of conventionally bonded fiber boards. For this purpose fiber insulating boards with a bulk density of 180 kg/m(3) and a thickness of 40 mm were produced and tested in regards to physical technical properties such as internal bond strength (IB), compressive strength (CS) and water absorption (WA) over 24 h. The objective of this study was to understand whether an optimal relationship of hot-air and hot-steam exists in relation to physical technical properties. Present work has shown that the steam treatment offered enhancing effects in regards to both internal bond and water uptake after 24 h. However, the best results were achieved by using hot-air/hot-steam in combination for curing. Here the condensation heat was exploited to obtain higher temperatures for a better lignin repolymerization. In conclusion, the results show that a partial substitution of pMDI by LMS is generally possible and curing via hot-air/hot-steam is advisable; however, the maximum evaporation time should be restricted to 10 s.

Amino Acid Catabolism: An Overlooked Area of Metabolism	NUTRIENTS												Amino acids have been extensively studied in nutrition, mainly as key elements for maintaining optimal protein synthesis in the body as well as precursors of various nitrogen-containing compounds. However, it is now known that amino acid catabolism is an important element for the metabolic control of different biological processes, although it is still a developing field to have a deeper understanding of its biological implications. The mechanisms involved in the regulation of amino acid catabolism now include the contribution of the gut microbiota to amino acid oxidation and metabolite generation in the intestine, the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional control, and the participation of specific miRNAs involved in the regulation of amino acid degrading enzymes. In addition, molecules derived from amino acid catabolism play a role in metabolism as they are used in the epigenetic regulation of many genes. Thus, this review aims to examine the mechanisms of amino acid catabolism and to support the idea that this process is associated with the immune response, abnormalities during obesity, in particular insulin resistance, and the regulation of thermogenesis.

We have previously reported that DIC contains a varying amount of sulfur (61-2030 ppm), and that the main S-containing impurity in DIC is the thiourea DITU, which exhibits an excellent ability to suppress side reactions caused by N-oxyl radicals formed from common N-hydroxyl-coupling additives such as HOBt and Oxyma (Green Chem. 2019, 21, 5990). Aiming to understand how the quality of DIC impacts peptide synthesis, here, we report an evaluation of 14 batches of GMP-grade DIC from seven different vendors. With the evaluation by elemental analysis (S), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance, we determined that the main Scontaining impurity in DIC currently in use is not DITU, but rather the diazetidine-2-thione [1,3-diisopropyl-4-(isopropylimino)1,3-diazetidine-2-thione, DIDT], formed by a 2 + 2 cycloaddition between DIC and iPr-NCS. The identity of DIDT was confirmed by a synthesis from DIC and iPr-NCS, followed by spiking a batch of DIC with the synthesized DIDT material. In a comparative evaluation of DITU and DIDT aimed at determining their ability to suppress breakdown of Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-OH caused by N-oxyl radicals formed from Oxyma, DITU completely prevented the Cys decomposition, whereas DIDT had no effect on the suppression of the breakdown of the amino acid. Finally, catalytic amounts of DITU as well as thiols DTT and NAC had a positive effect on minimization of the HOBt-induced breakdown of Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH, whereas the urea DIU, formed in every DIC-mediated peptide coupling reaction, accelerated the breakdown of the Trp substrate.

Herein, we report the fabrication of interconnected Ag nanostructures on the unmodified filter paper-based flexible substrates by a facile recipe, which involves evaporation of Ag precursor solution on the filter paper followed by its reduction with a strong reducing agent, NaBH4. The fabrication process is time-efficient, reproducible, and has the potential of being scaled up. The presence of inter-connected nanostructures results in high concentration of uniformly distributed hotspots on the substrate, which in turn provide excellent and reproducible SERS sensitivity. The finite element simulation results showed that fabricated nanostructures are much more effective for field enhancement as compared to the agglomerated spherical nanoparticles. Crystal violet (CV) concentration of 10-8 M was easily detected with these substrates both via solution drying and swabbing. Similarly, AgFPS have proven effective for swab-based detection of urea nitrate (UN), a well-known constituent of homemade explosives. The C-N and NO3 - symmetric stretching modes of UN are detectable down to 1 ?M and 100 ?M concentrations, respectively. Moreover, these substrates showed SERS signal uniformity both from different spots of a single substrate, and substrates from different batches, with spot-to-spot relative standard deviation (RSD) of 15% and sample-to-sample RSD of 15?19%. This makes them excellent for reliable and quick quantitative detection. The simple synthesis strategy, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and quantitative detection makes these substrates ideal for SERS based trace detection, especially for on-site analysis, and various sensing applications.

The results revealed that the pesticide is unstable in both media. In fresh water, it underwent hydrolysis whereas a degradation to several metabolites has been observed in sludge. The rate constants for the hydrolysis and degradation at 25 degrees C were 0.0.0067 and 0.0.0099 d(-1), respectively. Monitoring the degradation of imidacloprid in sludge by high-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) revealed that five metabolites have emerged during the study. These metabolites include imidacloprid urea, imidacloprid-guanidine, 6-hydroxynicotinic acid, an olefin, and 5-hydroxy, 1-(6-chloro-3-pyridylmethyl)-2-(nitroimino)-imidazolidin-5-ol. The efficiency of Al-Quds University Wastewater Treatment Plant towards the removal of imidacloprid indicates that the ultrafiltration-hollow fiber unit was insufficient, whereas the ultrafiltration-spiral wound, activated carbon, and reverse osmosis units were efficient for complete removal of the pesticide. Adsorption experiments of imidacloprid using either activated charcoal or micelle-clay complex were found to fit Langmuir isotherms better than Freundlich isotherm. The data demonstrate a higher Langmuir Q(max) value for the activated charcoal (126.6 mg g(-1)) when compared to the micelle-clay complex (11.76 mg g(-1)). Filtration column experiments conducted with mixed micelle-clay complex and sand (using a ratio of 1/50 by mass) at a flow rate of 2 mL min(-1) and influent concentration of 50 mg L-1 revealed that a sufficient removal of imidacloprid was achieved in the first fraction of 100 mL elution. These findings indicate that the adsorption technology using the micelle-clay complex provides efficient removal of imidacloprid in continuous flow mode.

Aquatic plants can facilitate the growth of rhizosphere microorganisms. This study investigated the impact of ammonium pollution on the anammox and denitrifying bacteria in the rhizosphere of a cultivated submerged macrophyte, Potamogeton crispus (P. crispus) by adding three different concentrations of slow-release urea (0, 400, 600 mg per kg sediment) to the sediment to simulate different levels of nitrogen pollution in the lake. Results showed that the ammonium concentrations in the interstitial water under three pollution treatments were significantly different, but the nitrate concentration remained stable. The abundance of anammox 16S rRNA and nitrite reductase (nirS) gene in rhizosphere sediments exhibited no significant differences under the three pollution conditions. The increase in the nitrogen pollution levels did not significantly affect the growth of anammox bacteria and nirS denitrifying bacteria (denitrifiers). The change trend of the abundance ratio of (anammox 16S rRNA)/nirS in different nitrogen treatment groups on the same sampling date was very close, indicating that this ratio was not affected by ammonium pollution levels when P. crispus existed. The redundancy analysis showed that there was a positive correlation between the abundance of anammox 16S rRNA and nirS gene and that the abundance of these bacteria was significantly affected by the mole ratio of NH4+/NO3-. This study reveals that submerged plants weaken the environmental changes caused by ammonia pollution in the rhizosphere, thereby avoiding strong fluctuation of anammox bacteria and nirS denitrifiers.

Metabolomics Analysis Reveals Deranged Energy Metabolism and Amino Acid Metabolic Reprogramming in Dogs With Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION												Background Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD), a naturally occurring heart disease, affects 10% to 15% of the canine population. Canine MMVD shares many similarities with human MMVD. Untargeted metabolomics was performed to identify changes in metabolic pathways and biomarkers with potential clinical utilities. Methods and Results Serum samples from 27 healthy, 22 stage B1, 18 stage B2 preclinical MMVD dogs, and 17 MMVD dogs with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) were analyzed. Linear regression analysis identified 173 known metabolites whose concentrations were different among the 4 groups (adjusted P<0.05), of which 40% belonged to amino acid super pathways, while 30% were lipids. More than 50% of significant metabolites were correlated with left atrial diameter but not left ventricular dimension. Acylcarnitines, tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, and creatine accumulated in proportion to MMVD severity. alpha-Ketobutyrate and ketone bodies were increased as MMVD advanced. Nicotinamide, a key substrate of the main nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) salvage pathway, was decreased, while quinolinate of the de novo NAD(+) biosynthesis was increased in CHF dogs versus healthy dogs. 3-Methylhistidine, marker for myofibrillar protein degradation, was higher in CHF dogs than non-CHF dogs. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and TMAO-producing precursors, including carnitine, phosphatidylcholine, betaine, and trimethyllysine, were increased in CHF dogs versus non-CHF dogs. Elevated levels of uremic toxins, including guanidino compounds, TMAO, and urea, were observed in CHF dogs. Pathway analysis highlighted the importance of bioenergetics and amino acid metabolism in canine MMVD. Conclusions Our study revealed altered energy metabolism, amino acid metabolic programming, and reduced renal function in the development of MMVD and CHF. Complex interplays along the heart-kidney-gut axis were implicated.

For this purpose, we have conducted transient response experiments over mechanical mixtures of an SCR catalyst (Fe-ZSM-5 or Cu-CHA) and a NOx storage material (BaO/Al2O3), which is able to trap and stabilize highly reactive NOx species. The results conclusively confirm that NO oxidative activation forms a gaseous intermediate, which acts like a nitrite precursor (e.g. HONO/N2O3) and is eventually stored on BaO/Al2O3. Such a species is also able to react with ammonia to produce N-2, and is therefore proposed as a key intermediate of the standard SCR mechanism. We have further demonstrated that the capability of chemical trapping mechanical mixtures to capture NO in O-2 at low temperature can also be exploited in practical applications for NOx emission control during cold start transients of diesel vehicles. In fact, such systems (SCR catalyst + NOx storage material) are characterized by an intrinsic dual functionality, being able both to store NOx when urea cannot be injected (e.g. below 170 degrees C) and to reduce the stored NOx with ammonia at higher temperatures in a single device. Accordingly, these mixtures have been renamed adsorption + selective catalytic reduction (AdSCR) systems. This review will summarize the main results achieved when implementing mechanical mixtures of NOx adsorbers and SCR catalysts both for fundamental understanding of the standard SCR mechanism and for abatement of cold start emissions.

In this work, for the first time, a robust, easily separable and reusable biocatalyst, Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Lac, was used for the degradation of a novel mineral flotation reagent 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ). Under optimized conditions, Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Lac achieved 89.2% 8-HQ degradation efficiency within 6 h. The effect of the main constituents of MPW on 8-HQ degradation, including metal ions, organic solvents, surfactant, metal chelator and flotation frother was evaluated. The Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Lac also displayed favorable degradation efficiency of 8-HQ in real lead-zinc mine water. The biocatalyst could be easily recovered and had a satisfactory reusability, retaining 64.5% of 8-HQ degradation efficiency in the sixth reaction cycle. Identification of intermediate products revealed that Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Lac mediated reaction predominantly generated various structural 8-HQ oligomers/polymers. A potential degradation pathway for 8-HQ was speculated as follows: Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Lac initially catalyzed the oxidation of 8-HQ to yield the corresponding reactive radical intermediates, which subsequently undergone self-coupling reaction via C-C and C-O-C covalent coupling at their ortho and/or para positions, finally forming oligomers and polymers. The inhibition assays of marine bacterium (Vibrio fischeri) demonstrated that the toxicity of 8-HQ and its intermediate products was effectively reduced after Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Lac treatment. The results of this study might present an alternative immobilized laccase-based clean biotechnology for the clean-up and detoxification of 8-HQ contaminated MPW.

In recent years, breakthroughs in designing catalysts, optimizing intrinsic activity, developing reactors, and elucidating reaction mechanisms have continuously driven the advancement of CO2 electroreduction. However, the industrialization of CO2 electroreduction remains a challenging task, with high energy consumption, high costs, limited reaction products, and restricted application scenarios being the issues that urgently need to be addressed. To accelerate the progress of CO2 electroreduction towards practical application, this review shifts the research focus from catalysts to aspects such as reactions and systems, aiming to improve reaction efficiency, reduce technical costs, expand the range of products, and enhance selectivity, offering readers a new perspective. In particular, innovative and specific design strategies such as CO2 reduction coupled with alternative oxidation, co-reduction reaction of CO2 and C/N/O/S-containing species, cascade systems, and integrated CO2 capture and reduction systems are discussed in detail.

J	Li, SY; Song, XL				Li, Shengyan; Song, Xianliang			Study on the preparation and production factors of a direct lignocellulose biomass fuel cell	JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant renewable resource in nature. However, low-temperature fuel cell technology has not yet been able to use it as an efficient fuel. In this research study, a low temperature direct biomass fuel cell, which did not use enzymes or microorganisms as catalysts, was demonstrated using barley straw as the fuel, methyl violet as an electron mediator, nickel foam as an anode, and carbon cloth supported 0.15 mg/cm(2) of 10 wt% Pt/C doping graphene as a cathode. The effects of the particle sizes of the raw materials on the performance of the fuel cell were examined using 3% (w/v) different particle sizes of barley straw powder in 5 M NaOH and 0.02 M MV solutions. It was found that the smaller the particle size of barley straw powder was, the higher the electrochemical performance of the fuel cell would be. In addition, this study also examined the effects of several dissolution systems on the electrochemical performance of the fuel cell, including a 10 wt% LiCl/DMAC, 5 M NaOH, 7 wt% NaOH/12 wt% Urea, and 65 wt% ZnCl2. It was found that the fuel cell in the 65 wt% ZnCl2 solvent had the best electrochemical performance, and when the MV concentration increased, the electrochemical performance of the fuel cell also increased accordingly. The maximum power density of the fuel cell reached to 0.3 mW/cm(2) when the concentration of MV increased to 0.08 M, which was nearly 40 times higher than the microbial fuel cells fed with cellulose. Meanwhile, the open circuit voltage was 541 mV, and the limit current density was 0.3 mA/cm(2). This allowed the raw materials of the fuel cell to take a further step toward a more complex lignocellulosic biomass.																			1572-6657	1873-2569				FEB 1	2018	810						55	61		10.1016/j.jelechem.2017.12.085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2017.12.085													WOS:000425560800008

The effect of rosemary herb as a dietary supplement on performance, egg quality, serum biochemical parameters, and oxidative status in laying hens	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND FEED SCIENCES												The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of rosemary herb on performance, egg quality, blood profile, immune function and antioxidant status in Hi-sex Brown laying hens. A total of 96 thirty-six-week-old laying hens were assigned to 4 dietary treatments (6 replications of 4 hens per group) and were fed the control diet or diets supplemented with 3, 6 or 9 g.kg(-1) of rosemary powder until 52 weeks of age. There were no differences in live body weight, feed consumption, feed conversion ratio or egg weight due to adding rosemary. Egg numbers and egg mass linearly increased with rosemary supplementation. Adding rosemary to laying hen diets resulted in a linear increase in yolk percent (P < 0.05) and yolk-to-albumen ratio (P = 0.01), and a decrease in albumen percent (P < 0.05) compared with the non-supplemented group. Serum constituents were not significantly influenced by rosemary, except urea, total cholesterol, immunoglobulins M (IgM) and A (IgA) concentrations. In comparison with the control group, the diet enriched with rosemary numerically reduced serum triglycerides, cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations, but HDL-cholesterol level was elevated with the same addition. Superoxide dismutase activity was linearly and quadratically (P = 0.007 and 0.002, respectively) increased in rosemary groups, and was maximized (290 U.ml(-1)) at 6 g.kg(-1) diet. In conclusion, rosemary supplemented up to 6 g.kg(-1) diet can be used as effective feed additive to improve performance, immunity and antioxidant status in laying hens.

J	Zhang, JY; Meng, S; Chen, WP; Cheng, YH; Zhu, MF				Zhang, Jun-yan; Meng, Si; Chen, Wen-ping; Cheng, Yan-hua; Zhu, Mei-fang			Continuous Bacterial Cellulose Aerogel Fibers with High Strength	ACTA POLYMERICA SINICA												Aerogel fibers have attracted increasing interests due to their high outside specific surface area and high flexibility for applications in energy management systems. However, aerogel fibers usually suffer from weak mechanical properties and complicated fabrication process, thus severely restricting their broad application. In this paper, the never-dried bacterial cellulose (BC) with high molecular weight was firstly dissolved in NaOH/urea/thiourea aqueous solution at -15 degrees C. Followed by wet spinning, solvent exchange and freeze-drying, the BC aerogel fiber with high mechanical properties was simply obtained. The dissolution process was observed by polarized optical microscope (POM), C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and viscoelastic measurements. The variations of structure and properties on original BC and regenerated BC aerogel fibers were characterized by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (ATR-FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The structure and properties of BC aerogel fiber were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), specific surface area and pore size distribution analyzer (BET) and fiber strength tester. The results show that the never-dried BC can be dissolved in NaOH/urealthiourea solution at low temperature. The maximum concentration of BC in the solution reaches up to 3 wt%. The resulted BC solution behaves as pseudoplastic fluid and stays stabe at room temperature. To fabricate BC aerogel fibers, wet-spinning technology and freeze-drying were utilized using BC solution as spinning dope. After regeneration, the crystal structure of BC transforms from I to II without derivatization. Meanwhile, highly porous structure in axial alignment with a high specific area of 192 m(2)/g was demonstrated in the BC aerogel fibers. Due to the high molecular weight of BC, strong intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, and molecular chain orientation, the tensile strength and Young's modulus of BC aerogel fibers could reach up to (9.36 +/- 1.68) MPa and (176 +/- 17.55) MPa, which are higher than those of state-of-the-art aerogel fibers. The lightweight BC aerogel fiber can withstand a load of more than 5 x10(4) times its own weight. Such BC aerogel fibers show high potentials in flexible biological scaffolds, drug carriers, bio-adsorbents and advanced thermal insulation textiles.

Proteome Remodeling of the Eye Lens at 50 Years Identified With Data-Independent Acquisition	MOLECULAR & CELLULAR PROTEOMICS												The eye lens is responsible for focusing and transmitting light to the retina. The lens does this in the absence of organelles, yet maintains transparency for at least 5 de-cades before onset of age-related nuclear cataract (ARNC). It is hypothesized that oxidative stress contrib-utes significantly to ARNC formation. It is in addition hypothesized that transparency is maintained by a microcirculation system that delivers antioxidants to the lens nucleus and exports small molecule waste. Com-mon data-dependent acquisition methods are hindered by dynamic range of lens protein expression and provide limited context to age-related changes in the lens. In this study, we utilized data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry to analyze the urea-insoluble membrane protein fractions of 16 human lenses subdivided into three spatially distinct lens regions to characterize age -related changes, particularly concerning the lens microcirculation system and oxidative stress response. In this pilot cohort, we measured 4788 distinct protein groups, 46,681 peptides, and 7592 deamidated se-quences, more than in any previous human lens data -dependent acquisition approach. Principally, we demonstrate that a significant proteome remodeling event occurs at approximately 50 years of age, resulting in metabolic preference for anaerobic glycolysis estab-lished with organelle degradation, decreased abundance of protein networks involved in calcium-dependent cell- cell contacts while retaining networks related to oxida-tive stress response. Furthermore, we identified multiple antioxidant transporter proteins not previously detected in the human lens and describe their spatiotemporal and age-related abundance changes. Finally, we demon-strate that aquaporin-5, among other proteins, is modi-fied with age by post-translational modifications including deamidation and truncation. We suggest that the continued accumulation of each of these age-related outcomes in proteome remodeling contribute to decreased fiber cell permeability and result in ARNC formation.

Obesity is a syndrome of multifactorial etiology characterized by an excessive accumulation and release of fatty acids (FA) in adipose and non-adipose tissue. An excess of FA generates a metabolic condition known as lipotoxicity, which triggers pathological cellular and molecular responses, causing dysregulation of homeostasis and a decrease in cell viability. This condition is a hallmark of NDs, and astrocytes are particularly sensitive to it, given their crucial role in energy production and oxidative stress management in the brain. However, analyzing cellular mechanisms associated with these conditions represents a challenge. In this regard, metabolomics is an approach that allows biochemical analysis from the comprehensive perspective of cell physiology. This technique allows cellular metabolic profiles to be determined in different biological contexts, such as those of NDs and specific metabolic insults, including lipotoxicity. Since data provided by metabolomics can be complex and difficult to interpret, alternative data analysis techniques such as machine learning (ML) have grown exponentially in areas related to omics data. Here, we developed an ML model yielding a 93% area under the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve, with sensibility and specificity values of 80% and 93%, respectively. This study aimed to analyze the metabolomic profiles of human astrocytes under lipotoxic conditions to provide powerful insights, such as potential biomarkers for scenarios of lipotoxicity induced by palmitic acid (PA). In this work, we propose that dysregulation in seleno-amino acid metabolism, urea cycle, and glutamate metabolism pathways are major triggers in astrocyte lipotoxic scenarios, while increased metabolites such as alanine, adenosine, and glutamate are suggested as potential biomarkers, which, to our knowledge, have not been identified in human astrocytes and are proposed as candidates for further research and validation.

This study intends to find the gap between actual anammox working capacity under different water conditions and fertilizers in the laboratory. The N-15-isotopic tracer technique was used to measure anammox and denitrification rate, and anammox community structure was analyzed through high-throughput sequencing with cytochrome cd-1 nitrite reductase functional gene (an_nirS gene, initially found in Candidatus Scalindua). The experiment consisted of four treatments, i.e., (I) CK_Control, (II) UR_Urea, (III) PM_Pig Manure, and (IV) SRF_Slow release fertilizer, under two water conditions, i.e., (a) Continuous flooding_CF, (b) Alternate wetting and drying_AWD. Results showed that anammox under CF decreased over time by -40.24%, and denitrification increased up to 39.25%. However, anammox activity under AWD increased up to 10.62% with the availability of NO2-, and surprisingly accompanied by the reduction in denitrification loss (-31.97%), being the most critical factor. We found that soil nifH and AOB genes were strongly favorable for anammox activity, while we observed the presence of anammox and AOB genes co-existing at the same time in paddy soil. The high-throughput sequencing with an_nirS functional gene showed a much higher diversity of anammox genera ever reported, mostly uncultured and unidentified. We concluded that water management is more prominent than fertilizer for anammox, and the most critical factor is the duration of AWD cycle, because of short term air supply could boost anammox activity and gene abundance, and could reduce denitrifier activity as well as nirK gene abundance.

A current challenge is to understand the environmental impacts of this crop across the different cultivation stages considering greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the present study evaluated whether inorganic fertilization with ammonium sulphate and urea during different planting stages can change soil CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions. The experiment was conducted in 2018 in an Atlantic Forest region of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. We used the chamber-based methodology for gas sampling in young and established banana plantations and in a forest remnant fragment. Seasonal differences in temperature and rainfall during the sampling period resulted in a larger WFPS during the wet season. The CO2 emissions followed the rainfall variations. CH4 fluxes were mainly resulted of methanotrophy reactions. The maximum and minimum N2O fluxes were 7.38 and -0.93 mg m(2) day(-1), peaking after nitrogen fertilization. We found that the accumulated N2O fluxes from soil were greater for the two banana plantations than those observed in the forest remnant in dry and wet seasons. The highest N2O peaks were observed in the young banana plantation. CH4 uptake was 92 and 61% less in young and established banana plantations than in the forest remnant, while N2O emissions were 95 and 74% greater in young and established banana plantations than in the forest remnant. Considering the negative effect of N2O emissions, reduced rates of nitrogen application and the adoption of conservation practices should be considered in young banana plantations.

S.; Albrechtsen, Nicolai J. Wewer			The Liver-α-Cell Axis in Health and in Disease	DIABETES												Glucagon and insulin are the main regulators of blood glucose. While the actions of insulin are extensively mapped, less is known about glucagon. Besides glucagon's role in glucose homeostasis, there are additional links between the pancreatic alpha-cells and the hepatocytes, often collectively referred to as the liver-alpha-cell axis, that may be of importance for health and disease. Thus, glucagon receptor antagonism (pharmacological or genetic), which disrupts the liver-alpha-cell axis, results not only in lower fasting glucose but also in reduced amino acid turnover and dyslipidemia. Here, we review the actions of glucagon on glucose homeostasis, amino acid catabolism, and lipid metabolism in the context of the liver-alpha-cell axis. The concept of glucagon resistance is also discussed, and we argue that the various elements of the liver-alpha-cell axis may be differentially affected in metabolic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This conceptual rethinking of glucagon biology may explain why patients with type 2 diabetes have hyperglucagonemia and how NAFLD disrupts the liver-alpha-cell axis, compromising the normal glucagon-mediated enhancement of substrate-induced amino acid turnover and possibly fatty acid beta-oxidation. In contrast to amino acid catabolism, glucagon-induced glucose production may not be affected by NAFLD, explaining the diabetogenic effect of NAFLD-associated hyperglucagonemia. Consideration of the liver-alpha-cell axis is essential to understanding the complex pathophysiology underlying diabetes and other metabolic diseases.

However, little is known about its effect on active nitrifying populations. Here we investigated the responses of nitrification activity and active nitrifiers to elevated temperature in an acidic paddy soil. Methods (CO2)-C-13-DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP), qPCR and high-throughput sequencing were used to determine active nitrifying phylotypes as well as difference in their abundance and community composition incubated at field temperature (15 degrees C) and elevated temperature (20 degrees C). Results Urea application led to significant production of nitrate and growth of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) at both temperatures. Nitrification activity at elevated temperature was 148.3% and 18.5% higher than that of low temperature at day 28 and 56, respectively, accompanied by an increase in the extent of C-13-label incorporation by AOB. (CO2)-C-13-based SIP experiment indicated that both AOB and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were involved in the nitrification activity and the active ammonia oxidizers changed from AOA to AOB with elevated temperature. Significant variation of AOA communities was observed under different temperatures. Dominant C-13-labeled nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) shifted from Nitrospira moscoviensis to Nitrospira japonica with higher temperature. Conclusions Our findings emphasized that elevated temperature had pronounced effects on autotrophic nitrification which was mediated by altering relative abundance of active AOB and AOA, as well as the community composition of AOA and NOB. AOB were more adaptable than AOA with increasing abundance but no alteration of composition at elevated temperature.					xu, jianmin/G-8032-2012; Li, Yong/G-2884-2019; He, Yan/F-1024-2012; Brookes, Philip/ABW-6646-2022	He, Yan/0000-0002-1721-7711													0032-079X	1573-5036				DEC	2019	445	1-2			SI		71	83		10.1007/s11104-019-04052-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04052-7													WOS:000509537400006

CQD@FeOOH exhibited remarkable degradation performance toward refractory phenol in a synergic photocatalytic/Fenton system, with a rate constant (k) 2.8 times higher than that of pristine alpha FeOOH. Moreover, the k value of CQD@FeOOH as a heterogeneous photo-Fenton catalyst was 12.6 and 3.1 times than those of CQD@FeOOH as photocatalysis and Fenton catalysis, respectively. The hybrid materials were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques to prove that carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were successfully modified on alpha FeOOH to form Fe-O-C bonds. The electrochemical impedance spectra, transient photocurrent performance, photoluminescence spectra, and other photoelectric performance analyses confirmed the strong interaction between alpha FeOOH and the CQDs, which facilitated the rapid interfacial transfer of photogenerated electrons from alpha FeOOH to CQDs and enhanced the absorption of photons under visible light irradiation. Radical quenching experiments and electron spin resonance analysis demonstrated that (OH)-O-center dot and O-center dot(2)- are the main active species for the synergic photo-Fenton degradation. Furthermore, CQD@FeOOH maintained high catalytic activity, high crystallinity, and extremely low iron leaching during repeated experiments. By optimizing degradation conditions, it was found that a low concentration of H2O2 and a wide pH range could maintain high catalytic performance. This work presents a feasible strategy to design and fabricate heterogeneous photo-Fenton catalysts for the removal of organic pollutants.

DNA-SIP indicates that ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were labeled to a much greater extent in the CK soil (74.6%) than in the NPK-amended (19.8%) or M-amended (27.1%) soils at 28 degrees C. In contrast, NPK soil showed the highest labeling of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) (23.3%) relative to M (4.03%) and CK (2.42%) soils. This is further supported by significant decreases in the(13)C-amoAgene ratios of AOA/AOB in the NPK (4.14) and M (8.63) compared with CK (46.4) soils at 28 degrees C, while little difference was observed at 35 degrees C. The relative abundance of active AOA or AOB in the manure was between that in the CK and NPK soils. This may be attributable to the slower release of ammonium mineralized from manure than from urea. The active AOA in soil microcosms were dominated byNitrososphaera viennensis-like groups regardless of fertilization history or temperature.Nitrosomonas communis-like AOB may be more adapted to the higher temperature thanNitrosospiracluster 3-like AOB. The labeling of nitrite oxidizers (nitrite-oxidizing bacteria) was lowest in NPK soil and was higher at 28 degrees C than 35 degrees C regardless of fertilization treatment. The finding indicates that intensified anthropogenic N inputs in the field may select for distinct active nitrifying communities that exhibited different temperature sensitivities.

Effect of TiO2 polymorph and alcohol sacrificial agent on the activity of Au/TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production in alcohol-water mixtures	JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS												This study compares the performance of 5 different Au/TiO2 photocatalysts for H-2 production in alcohol-water mixtures under UV excitation, placing particular emphasis on the role of the TiO2 support and alcohol sacrificial reagent. 1.5 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalysts were prepared by the deposition-precipitation with urea method, using P25 TiO2 (85% anatase and 15% rutile, 49 m(2) g(-1)), sol-gel anatase (39 m(2) g(-1)), hydrothermally synthesised anatase (115 m(2) g(-1)), commercial brookite (33 m(2) g(-1)) and hydrothermally synthesised rutile (29 m(2) g(-1)) as supports. UV-Vis, TEM, XRD, XPS and Au L-3-edge EXAFS characterisation studies confirmed the presence of gold nanoparticles of mean size 5-10 nm on all the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, which generated intense localised surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) centred between 560 and 590 nm. Gold nanoparticle deposition suppressed electron-hole pair recombination in each TiO2 support following UV excitation, and created cathodic sites on TiO2 for H-2 evolution. Photocatalytic H-2 production tests were conducted in water, methanol-water, ethanol-water, ethylene glycol-water and glycerol-water mixtures (alcohol concentration 10 vol.%) at a UV flux of 6.5 mW cm(-2). H-2 production rates decreased in the order Au/P25 > Au/anatase SG approximate to Au/brookite > Au/anatase HT >> Au/rutile HT when the rates were normalised against photocatalyst surface area. For each Au/TiO2 photocatalyst, the rates decreased in the order glycerol > ethylene glycol > methanol > ethanol. Good correlations were established between H-2 production rates and the number of hydroxyl groups, polarity and relative hole scavenging ability of the alcohols. Results improve knowledge about the role of sacrificial reagents in photocatalytic hydrogen production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The synthesized MIP prepared by using dual functional monomers 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid and 4vinylpyridine was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements. The optimized pH for adsorption of sarcosine was 5.0 and the elution was completed with MeOH:HAc (90:10, v/v), whilst the electrochemical determination was performed in FIA system using a sample volume of 121.0 mu L, 0.05 mol L-1 NaOH carrier solution, a flow rate of 2.0 mL min-1 and applied potential of 0.7 V vs Ag/AgCl. The proposed method provided enrichment factor of 50.6-fold, linear analytical curve from 3.2 to 25.0 mu mol L-1 (R-2 = 0.995), and limit of detection of 0.96 mu mol L-1. The precision was evaluated in terms of intra (n = 6) and interday (n = 2) for concentrations of 10.0, 15.0, and 20.0 mu mol L-1, giving rise to low percentages of relative standard deviations (RSD %), ranging from 2.2 to 4.3%. A highly improved response for sarcosine using MIP when compared to NIP (non-imprinted polymer) was obtained. The method also exhibited higher selectivity toward sarcosine compared to glycine, alanine, proline, and urea. Analysis of synthetic urine samples yielded recoveries in the range of 95.0-108.0%, thereby indicating the absence of matrix effect and the feasibility of the method for sarcosine determination.

The contents of reactive functional groups (graphitic N, pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, nitric oxide and C=O) and catalytic performance of NG were delicately controlled by adjusting thermal annealing temperature. Thermal annealing temperature of >= 500 degrees C was required to produce the NG endowed with catalytic activity for SAM degradation via PMS activation. NG600 (NG prepared at 600 degrees C) with a high N doping level (16.0 wt%) and a most optimum amount of pyridinic N (38.4%N), pyrrolic N (31.8%N), graphitic N (25.9%N) and C=O groups (43.7%O) exhibited the most outstanding catalytic activity to activate PMS. NG600 with the controlled N bonding configurations possessed a higher SAM degradation efficiency than NGs prepared via other optimized synthesis methods The specific surface area (SSA) contributed less significantly than N doping to the SAM degradation performance. Increments in the PMS dosage and catalyst loading were both conducive to the catalytic performance of NG. The presence of NO3- in the NG600/PMS system had a negligible influence on SAM degradation but C-l(-) and humic acid decreased the SAM degradation rate. Experiments using chemical scavengers and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study revealed that SAM degradation process follows predominantly the radical pathway with sulfate radical (SO4 center dot(-)) as the main reactive oxygen species over the non-radical pathway.

Enhanced cytotoxicity of imidacloprid by biotransformation in isolated hepatocytes and perfused rat liver	PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY												Imidacloprid (IMD) is a neonicotinoid insecticide widely used in crops, pets, and on farm animals for pest control, which can cause hepatotoxicity in animals and humans. In a previous study using isolated rat liver mitochondria, we observed that IMD inhibited the activity of FoF1-ATP synthase. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of IMD on rat isolated hepatocytes and perfused rat liver, besides the influence of its bio-transformation on the toxicological potential. For the latter goal, rats were pretreated with dexamethasone or phenobarbital, two classical cytochrome P-450 stimulators, before hepatocytes isolation or liver perfusion. IMD (150 and 200 mu M) reduced state 3 mitochondrial respiration in digitonin-permeabilized cells that were energized with glutamate plus malate but did not dissipate the mitochondrial membrane potential. In intact (non-permeabilized) hepatocytes, the intracellular ATP concentration and cell viability were reduced when high IMD concentrations were used (1.5-3.0 mM), and only in cells isolated from dexamethasone-pretreated rats, revealing that IMD biotransformation increases its toxicity and that IMD itself affects isolated mitochondria or mitochondria in permeabilized hepatocytes in concentrations that do not affect mitochondrial function in intact hepatocytes. Coherently, in the prefused liver, IMD (150 and 250 mu M) inhibited gluconeogenesis from alanine, but without affecting oxygen consumption and urea production, indicating that such effect was not of mitochondrial origin. The gluconeogenesis inhibition was incomplete and occurred only when the rats were pretreated with phenobarbital, signs that IMD biotransformation was involved in the observed effect. Our findings reveal that changes in hepatic energy metabolism may be acutely implicated in the hepatotoxicity of IMD only when animals and humans are exposed to high levels of this compound, and that IMD metabolites seem to be the main cause for its toxicity.

Here, we sampled bacteria inhabiting a prevalent coral species Platygyra acuta and sequenced genomes of 234 isolates comprising two populations in Rhodobacteraceae, an alphaproteobacterial lineage representing a significant but variable proportion (5-50%) of the coral microbiota. The Ruegeria population (20 genomes) contains three clades represented by eight, six, and six isolates predominantly sampled from the skeleton (outgroup), mucus (clade-M), and skeleton (clade-S), respectively. The clade-M possesses functions involved in the utilization of coral osmolytes abundant in the mucus (e.g., methylamines, DMSP, taurine, and L-proline), whereas the clade-S uniquely harbors traits that may promote adaptation to the low-energy and diurnally anoxic skeleton (e.g., sulfur oxidation and swimming motility). These between-clade genetic differences were largely supported by physiological assays. Expanded analyses by including genomes of 24 related isolates (including seven new genomes) from other marine environments suggest that clade-M and clade-S may have diversified in non-coral habitats, but they also consolidated a key role of distinct coral compartments in diversifying many of the above-mentioned traits. The unassigned Rhodobacteraceae population (214 genomes) varies only at a few dozen nucleotide sites across the whole genomes, but the number of between-compartment migration events predicted by the Slatkin-Maddison test supported that dispersal limitation between coral compartments is another key mechanism diversifying microbial populations. Collectively, our results suggest that different coral compartments represent ecologically distinct and microgeographically separate habitats that drive the evolution of the coral microbiota.

J	Dobslaw, D; Engesser, KH; Störk, H; Gerl, T				Dobslaw, Daniel; Engesser, Karl-Heinrich; Stoerk, Hans; Gerl, Thomas			Low-cost process for emission abatement of biogas internal combustion engines	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Biogas internal combustion (IC) engines of less than 1 MW are either equipped with an oxidative catalyst or operate at low-emission operation parameters to meet national emission standards of NOx, CO, VOCs, HCl, H2S, SO2, and formaldehyde safely. However, expensive oxidative catalysts have a limited lifetime of less than two years, and electrical efficiency at low-emission conditions is lower than that at optimal conditions, characterized by higher emission levels. While NOx levels increased seven times from 282.2 to 1965.7 mg NORx.m(-3) by changing the operational parameters of the four-stroke gas engine (P-el = 360 kW), emission levels of CO and VOC slightly changed from 540.3 to 452.5 mg CO.m(-3) and 509.6 to 329.9 mg C.m(-3). Furthermore, NOx emission levels could be reduced by a minor air to gas ratio, but levels of VOC, CO, and HCl increased at these conditions as shown for a four-stroke gas engine (P-el = 635 kW). The emissions of the dual-fuel gas compression-ignition engine (P-el = 265 kW) were generally characterized by higher emission levels. A chemical scrubber with an optional subsequent biofilter was installed as a low-cost alternative for oxidative catalysts as a waste gas treatment system. Corresponding performance levels of the chemical scrubber were in the range of 28.3-38.6% (NOx), 19.2-30.8% (CO), 22.6-23.8% (VOCs), and 33.3-70% (odor). Formaldehyde, which occurred at levels of 43.4-59.6 mg m(-3), was almost completely eliminated by the scrubber after injection of ambient air, but the system failed in tests without air injection. The performance was further enhanced by addition of H2O2. Further approaches in chemical removal of formaldehyde by addition of NH3 or urea failed. The biofilter showed no treatment performance under thermophilic conditions. The amortization time of the scrubber system was less than three years, caused by economic benefits of higher electrical efficiency and substitution of the catalyst. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A wearable dialysis device could solve most of the issues associated with the treatment, but the main obstacle to its realisation is an efficient and reliable system for dialysate regeneration, i.e. the purification of spent dialysate from uremic toxins. Several techniques have been proposed to this aim, such as enzymatic conversion, forward osmosis and electrochemical oxidation. One of the most promising and safe technologies is adsorption, in which toxins are captured onto nanoporous materials, polymers or their combinations (mixed matrix membranes). In this review, we first give a general overview of the hemodialysis processes and of the challenges associated to making it wearable. Subsequently, we use experimental data from the literature to rank different materials based on their ability to remove the typical uremic toxins present in dialysate, including considerations on their recyclability, stability and safety. Finally, we critically analyse different computational modelling techniques available to design and/or optimise adsorbent materials for dialysate regeneration, and their accuracy in predicting the materials performance and screen large databases of adsorbents.

Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) drive the rate-limiting step of nitrification. However, the effect of fertilization disturbances (organic amendments and biochemical inhibitors) on the resistance and resilience of communities of AOB and AOA is unknown. Here, we explored the responses of the AOA and AOB communities (based on abundance, diversity, richness and composition) after disturbances caused by the application of inorganic N (urea alone, IN), an organic amendment (cattle manure, OA), a urease inhibitor (NBPT) and a nitrification inhibitor (nitrapyrin) or their combination in a calcareous soil after 85 days. A relative quantitative index of both the resistance (RS) and resilience (RL) was used to assess the variation of gene communities. The AOB community a-diversity, richness and abundance rapidly increased at 7 days after IN and OA (P < 0.05) compared to CK (without any disturbances), whereas those factors decreased after OA + nitrapyrin or OA + nitrapyrin + NBPT application. The RS indices of AOA abundance and diversity were higher than those of AOB after the IN, OA and nitrapyrin disturbances, indicating AOA were more resistant. NMDS analysis showed that the changes in the composition of the AOB community were observed both at 7 and 85 days after OA + nitrapyrin disturbance. In contrast, the AOA community composition did not change within 85 days after these disturbances. Moreover, the RL indices of AOB community were much lower than those of AOA. Soil pH and ammonium (NH4-) played major roles in the changes in the AOB community in response to disturbance. Taken together, our results highlight that AOB are sensitive and not resilient to organic amendment or nitrapyrin disturbance, while AOA are resistant to these disturbances in calcareous soil.					hu, baowei/T-2476-2019														0016-7061	1872-6259				FEB 15	2021	384								114814	10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114814	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114814													WOS:000594244300018
J	Nor, NM; Chung, LL; Mohamed, AR				Nor, Norhusna Mohamad; Chung, Lau Lee; Mohamed, Abdul Rahman			Development of microwave-assisted nitrogen-modified activated carbon for efficient biogas desulfurization: a practical approach	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Removal of H2S (hydrogen sulfide) from biogas is anticipated for higher energy conversion of methane (CH4), while reducing the detrimental impacts of corroding the metal parts in the plant and its hazardous effect on humans and the environment. The introduction of microwave (MW) heating and nitrogen-modification could generate superior adsorbent features, contributing to high H2S removal. Up to date, there is no work reported on the influence of physicochemical characteristics of nitrogen-modified carbon synthesized via MW and conventional heating (TH) methods and their performance in H2S removal. Palm shell activated carbon (PSAC) was functionalized with nitrogen groups via urea impregnation, followed by the synthesis of MW and TH at 950 degrees C, 500 ml/min of N-2 flow rate and 30 min of heating time. MW and TH heating effects on the modified PSAC adsorbent were analysed and compared towards hydrogen sulfide (H2S) removal. PSAC with nitrogen functionalization produced using MW heating (PSAC-MW) demonstrates superior performance, with an adsorption capacity of 356.94 mg/g. The adsorbent sample generated using MW heating exhibited notable properties, including a large surface area and a sponge-like structure, with new pores developed within the current pores. Instead of that, there was an observation of 'hot spot' appearance during the MW heating process, which is believed to be responsible for the development of physical and chemical characteristics of the adsorbent. Thus, it is believed that MW heating was assisted in the development of the adsorbent's properties and at the same time contributed to the high removal of H2S at low adsorption temperature. The utilization of biomass-based adsorbent (PSAC) for H2S removal can address the lignocellulosic waste disposal problem, while mitigating the H2S release from the biogas production plants thus has several environmental merits. This indirectly contributed to zero-waste generation, while overcoming the adverse effects of H2S.

A double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in 59 Chinese patients with T2D, who were randomized to receive fish oil (FO), flaxseed oil (FSO) or corn oil (CO, serving as a control group) capsules for 180 days. Morning urine samples were collected before and after the intervention and were analyzed for metabolomics by UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap/MS in positive and negative ionization modes. In the FO group, levels of 2-hexenoylcarnitine (C6:1) (p < 0.001) and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid (CMPF) (p = 0.004) were significantly increased while hydroxyisovaleroyl carnitine (C5:OH) (p < 0.001) was significantly decreased compared with the CO group. In addition, geranylacetone (p = 0.023) and citronellyl propionate (p = 0.038) levels were significantly elevated, while dihydrojasmonic acid (p = 0.003) was significantly reduced in the FSO group compared with that in the CO group. Moreover, increased C6:1 was correlated with decreased serum triglycerides (r = -0.340, p = 0.020). The change of urine CMPF showed inverse correlation with blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (r = -0.338, p = 0.020), while C5:OH was positively correlated with apolipoprotein B (APOB) and BUN (r = 0.386, p = 0.015; r = 0.327, p = 0.025). Besides, the change of urine CMPF was positively correlated with serum CMPF (r = 0.646, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the present study confirmed that CMPF is a strong biomarker of fish oil, and indicated that marine n-3 PUFA intake might have a beneficial effect on lipid metabolism and renal function in patients with T2D.

The expensive and benign carrageenan served as the source of carbon, oxygen, and sulfur, whereas urea served as the nitrogen source. The material was prepared via direct mixing of precursors and freeze-drying followed by carbonization under nitrogen at 900 degrees C. Co@NOSC catalysts comprising a Co inner core and outer electron-rich heteroatom-doped carbon shell were thoroughly characterized using various techniques, namely, TEM, HRTEM, STEM elemental mapping, XPS, BET, and ICP-MS. The utility of the Co@NOSC catalyst was explored for base-free selective oxidative esterification of alcohols to the corresponding esters under mild reaction conditions; excellent conversions (up to 97%) and selectivities (up to 99%) were discerned. Furthermore, the substrate scope was explored for the cross-esterification of benzyl alcohol with long-chain alcohols (up to 98%) and lactonization of diols (up to 68%). The heterogeneous nature and stability of the catalyst facilitated by its ease of separation for long-term performance and recycling studies showed that the catalyst was robust and remained active even after six recycling experiments. EPR measurements were performed to deduce the reaction mechanism in the presence of POBN (alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone) as a spin-trapping agent, which confirmed the formation of (CH2OH)-C-center dot radicals and H-center dot radicals, wherein the solvent plays an active role in a nonconventional manner. A plausible mechanism was proposed for the oxidative esterification of alcohols on the basis of EPR findings. The presence of a cobalt core along with cobalt oxide and the electron-rich N-, O-, and S-doped carbon shell displayed synergistic effects to afford good to excellent yields of products.					/K-1530-2019; Petr, Martin/ABB-7139-2021; Zoppellaro, Giorgio/F-8453-2012; GAWANDE, Manoj/E-1550-2018; Kumar, Pawan/L-1750-2016; Petr, Martin/B-9628-2016; Nandan, Devaki/L-2356-2018; Varma, Rajender/M-8774-2013	KUMAR, PAWAN/0000-0003-2804-9298; Petr, Martin/0000-0002-7334-6147; Gawande, Manoj B./0000-0003-1575-094X; Nandan, Devaki/0000-0003-0248-024X; Medrik, Ivo/0000-0001-9793-5029; Zoppellaro, Giorgio/0000-0003-2304-2564; Aparicio, Claudia/0000-0002-6369-7621; Varma, Rajender/0000-0001-9731-6228; Zboril, Radek/0000-0002-3147-2196													1463-9262	1463-9270				AUG 7	2018	20	15					3542	3556		10.1039/c8gc01333k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8gc01333k													WOS:000441581600014

This study aimed to determine how hyperlactatemia affects lipolysis, glucose- and protein metabolism, and insulin sensitivity in healthy men. In a single-blind, randomized, crossover design, eight healthy men were studied after an overnight fast on two occasions: 1) during a sodium-lactate infusion (LAC) and 2) during a sodium-matched NaCl infusion (CTR). Both days consisted of a 3-h postabsorptive period followed by a 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEC). Lipolysis rate, endogenous glucose production (EGP), and delta glucose rate of disappearance (Delta Rd(glu)) were evaluated using [9,10-H-3]palmitate and [3-H-3]glucose tracers. In addition, whole body- and forearm protein metabolism was assessed using [N-15]phenylalanine, [H-2(4)]tyrosine, [N-15]tyrosine, and [C-13]urea tracers. In the postabsorptive period, plasma lactate increased to 2.7 +/- 0.5 mmol/L during LAC vs. 0.6 +/- 0.3 mmol/L during CTR (P < 0.001). In the postabsorptive period, palmitate flux was 30% lower during LAC compared with CTR (84 +/- 32 <mu>mol/min vs. 120 +/- 35 mu mol/min, P = 0.003). During the HEC, palmitate flux was suppressed similarly during both interventions (P = 0.7). EGP, Delta Rd(glu), and M value were similar during LAC and CTR. During HEC, LAC increased whole body phenylalanine flux (P = 0.02) and protein synthesis (P = 0.03) compared with CTR; LAC did not affect forearm protein metabolism compared with CTR. Lactate infusion inhibited lipolysis by 30% under postabsorptive conditions but did not affect glucose metabolism or improve insulin sensitivity. In addition, whole body phenylalanine flux was increased.

To obtain the bioactive agarose derivatives and expand the range of their potential use, the modification with some functional groups is needed. Agarose sulfates exhibit the anticoagulant, hypolipidemic, and other-type bioactivity. In this study, different methods for preparation of agarose sulfates using nontoxic ammonium sulfamate are investigated. Several activators and catalysts of the process of sulfation with ammonium sulfamate are examined. It is shown that urea does not significantly activate ammonium sulfamate in the sulfation reaction, while potassium permanganate ensures a sulfur content of up to 13.2 wt% in the synthesized agarose sulfate. When Lewis acids (titanium and aluminum oxides) are used, the sulfur content in agarose sulfates can only reach 7.3 wt%. The catalysts with the Bronsted acid sites used in the synthesis of sulfated agarose can provide sulfur contents of up to 14.6 wt% in it. The incorporation of a sulfate group into the agarose molecule has been confirmed by elemental analysis and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy: the absorption bands at 1249 cm-1 have been observed in the spectra. The X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy studies have revealed no ammonium sulfamate inclusions. According to the X-ray diffraction patterns, sulfation of agarose enhances its X-ray amorphism. It has been established from the atomic force microscopy images that the incorporation of a sulfate group into the agarose molecule changes the size of particles on the film surface from 42 to 80 nm. The theoretical examination of initial and sulfated agarose has been carried out within the density functional theory. The molecular geometry, vibration assignments, HOMO-LUMO, molecular electrostatic potential maps, and electronic properties of the substances have been established by the quantum-chemical calculations in the framework of the density functional theory.

J	Jamaluddin, RZAR; Tan, LL; Chong, KF; Heng, LY				Raja Jamaluddin, Raja Zaidatul Akhmar; Tan, Ling Ling; Chong, Kwok Feng; Heng, Lee Yook			An electrochemical DNA biosensor fabricated from graphene decorated with graphitic nanospheres	NANOTECHNOLOGY												Graphene decorated with graphitic nanospheres functionalized with pyrene butyric acid (PBA) is used for the first time to fabricate a DNA biosensor. The electrode was formed by attaching a DNA probe onto PBA, which had been stacked onto a graphene material decorated with graphene nanospheres (GNSs). The nanomaterial was drop-coated onto a carbon screen-printed electrode (SPE) to create the GNS-PBA modified electrode (GNS-PBA/SPE). A simple method was used to produce GNS by annealing graphene oxide (GO) solution at high temperature. Field emission scanning electron micrographs confirmed the presence of a spherical shape of GNS with a diameter range of 40-80 nm. A stable and uniform PBA-modified GNS (GNS-PBA) was obtained with a facile ultrasonication step. Thus allowing aminated DNA probes of genetically modified (GM) soybean to be attached to the nanomaterials to form the DNA biosensor. The GNS-PBA/SPE exhibited excellent electrical conductivity via cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) tests using potassium ferricyanide (K-3[Fe(CN)(6)]) as the electroactive probe. By employing an anthraquinone monosulfonic acid (AQMS) redox intercalator as the DNA hybridization indicator, the biosensor response was evaluated using the DPV electrochemical method. A good linear relationship between AQMS oxidation peak current and target DNA concentrations from 1.0 x 10(-16)to 1.0 x 10(-8)M with a limit of detection (LOD) of less than 1.0 x 10(-16)M was obtained. Selectivity experiments revealed that the voltammetric GM DNA biosensor could discriminate complementary sequences of GM soybean from non-complementary sequences and hence good recoveries were obtained for real GM soybean sample analysis. The main advantage of using GNS is an improvement of the DNA biosensor analytical performance.

They also play a crucial role in marine ecosystems by preventing the escape of methane into the atmosphere from diverse methane sources, such as methane seeps and hydrothermal vents. Despite their importance for methane carbon cycling, relatively few marine methanotrophic bacteria have been isolated and studied at the genomic level. Herein, we report the genome of a marine methanotrophic member of the genus Methylomicrobium, metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) wino1, which was obtained through enrichment using methane as the sole carbon source. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA sequences and comparison of pmoA genes supported the close relationship of MAG-winol to the genus Methylomicrobium and it possessed a genome of 5.06 Mb encoding many specialized methanotrophic genes. A comparison of MAG-wino1 with the genomes of other strains (Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z(T) and Methylomicrobium buryatense 5G) showed that genes (e.g. ectABC, ask, and mscLS) involved in the accumulation of compatible solutes required for survival in marine environments might be conserved. Methane utilization genes, including methanol dehydrogenase, and key enzymes related to ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) metabolism were identified. The wino1 genome harbored nitrogen fixation, urease, urea and nitrate transporter genes involved in the exploitation of nitrogen sources. Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate degradation and glycogen synthesis-related genes may facilitate survival under nutrient-limiting conditions. Additionally, genome analysis revealed three dominant taxa in the enrichment culture, methanotroph Methylomicrobium sp., methylotroph Methyloceanibacter sp., and non-methylotroph Labrenzia sp., which provided insights into microbial associations in marine sediments.

In addition, the electrochemical behavior of the synthesized composites was analyzed in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte with the help of cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). According to the statistics of different ratios of VO2 (D), it plays an indispensable role in the electrochemical properties of the synthesized composites. It has been found that the PGV0.3 sample at a scan rate of 2 mV s(-1) shows tremendous specific capacitance of 3263 F g(-1) with excellent cycling stability of 99.71% after 2000 cycles, and this value also correlates well with the GCD findings. However, the energy density of PPY at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) is found to be 15.6 W h kg(-1), while that of PGV0.3 is 138.2 W h kg(-1), which is nearly 8.86 times more than the energy density of PPY. The power densities of PPY and PGV0.3 at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) are found to be 151.7 W kg(-1) and 218.69 W kg(-1), respectively. The values of solution resistance (R-s) and charge transfer resistance (R-ct) of pyrrole and VO2 (D) are 5.60 omega and 3.77 omega, and 0.34 omega and 0.11 omega, respectively, while for PGV0.3 they are 1.28 omega and 0.07 omega, respectively. In this way, the authors have witnessed a quite appreciable capacitance furnished through the fabricated and optimized PGV0.3 electrode material in three-electrode and two-electrode systems.

Extrusion of lupines with or without addition of reducing sugars: Effects on the formation of Maillard reaction compounds, partition of nitrogen and Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine, and performance of dairy cows	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE												The extrusion of leguminous seeds induces the formation of Maillard reaction compounds (MRC) as a product of protein advanced glycation and oxidation, which lowers protein degradability in the rumen. However, the quantitative relationship between the parameters of pretreatment (i.e., addition of reducing sugars) and extrusion, and the formation of MRC has not been established yet. Moreover, the fate of the main stable MRC, N epsilon-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), in the excretory routes has never been investigated in ruminants. We aimed to test the effects of the tem-perature of extrusion of white lupines with or without addition of reducing sugars on the formation of MRC, crude protein (CP) degradability in the rumen, N use efficiency for milk production (milk N/N intake), and performance of dairy cows. Two experiments with a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design were conducted simultaneously with 16 (3 rumen-cannulated) multipa-rous Holstein cows to measure indicators of ruminal CP degradability (ruminal NH3 concentration, branched-chain volatile fatty acids), metabolizable protein supply (plasma essential AA concentration), N use efficiency (N isotopic discrimination), and dairy performance. In parallel, apparent total-tract digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fibers, N, total Lys and CML, and partition of N and CML were measured with 4 cows in both experiments. The diets consisted on a DM basis of 20% raw or extruded lupines and 80% basal mixed ration of corn silage, silage and hay from permanent grasslands, pelleted concentrate, and a vitaminized mineral mix. Expected output temperatures of lupine extrusion were 115 degrees C, 135 degrees C, and 150 degrees C, without and with the addition of reducing sugars be -fore extrusion. The extrusion numerically reduced the in vitro ruminal CP degradability of the lupines, and consequently increased the predicted supply of CP to the small intestine. Nitrogen balance and urinary N excretion did not differ among dietary treatments in either experiment. Milk yield and N use efficiency for milk production increased with extrusion of lupines at 150 degrees C without addition of reducing sugars compared with raw lupines. Nitrogen isotopic discrimination between dietary and animal proteins (the difference between delta 15N in plasma and delta 15N in the diet) were lower with lupines extruded at 150 degrees C without and with ad-dition of reducing sugars. Regardless of sugar addition, milk true protein yield was not affected, but milk urea concentration and fat: protein ratio were lower with lu-pines extruded at 150 degrees C than with raw lupines. In the CML partition study, we observed that on average 26% of the apparently digested CML was excreted in urine, and a much lower proportion (0.63% on average) of the apparently digested CML was secreted in milk, with no differences among dietary treatments. In conclusion, we showed that the extrusion of white lupines without or with addition of reducing sugars numerically reduced enzymatic CP degradability, with limited effects on N partition, but increased milk yield and N use efficiency at the highest temperature of extrusion without addi-tion of reducing sugars.

Expression of specific signaling components related to muscle protein turnover and of branched-chain amino acid catabolic enzymes in muscle and adipose tissue of preterm and term calves	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE												Postnatal metabolism depends on maturation of key metabolic pathways around birth. In this regard, en-dogenous glucose production is impaired in calves born preterm. Concerning protein metabolism, the rates of protein turnover are greater during the neonatal period than at any other period of postnatal life. The mam-malian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are considered as the major regulators of cellular protein turnover. The objectives of this study were to investigate (1) the changes in plasma AA profiles, (2) the mRNA abundance of mTOR signal-ing and UPS-related genes in skeletal muscle, and (3) the mRNA abundance of branched-chain AA (BCAA) catabolic enzymes in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in neonatal calves with different degree of maturation during the transition to extrauterine life. Calves (n = 7/treatment) were born either preterm (PT; delivered by cesarean section 9 d before term) or at term (T; spontaneous vaginal delivery) and were left unfed for 1 d. Calves in treatment TC were also spontaneously born but were fed colostrum and transition milk for 4 d. Blood samples were collected from all calves at birth and at 24 h of life. Additional blood samples were taken 2 h after feeding (26 h of life) for PT and T calves, and on d 4 of life for TC, to determine plasma glucose, urea, and AA. Tissue samples from 3 muscles [M. longissimus dorsi (MLD), M. semitendinosus (MST), and M. mas-seter (MM)], and kidney fat were collected following euthanasia at 26 h after birth (PT, T) or on d 4 of life (TC) at 2 h after feeding. The concentrations of the majority of plasma AA (Ala, Gln, Asn, Cit, Lys, Orn, Thr, and Tyr), nonessential AA, and total AA were greater during the first 24 h and also before and 2 h after feeding in PT than in T. The ratio of plasma BCAA to the aromatic AA (Tyr and Phe) was greatest in TC, followed by T, and least in PT. The mRNA abundance of mTOR and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) in MLD and MM was greater in PT and T than in TC. The mRNA abundance of muscle-specific ligases FBXO32 (F-box only protein 32) in the 3 different skel-etal muscles and TRIM63 (tripartite motif containing 63) in MLD was greater in PT and T than in TC; in MM, TRIM63 mRNA was greatest in PT. The mRNA for BCKDHA and BCKDHB (the alpha and beta polypeptide of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase) in kid-ney fat was elevated in PT and T compared with TC, suggesting a possible enhancement of BCAA oxidation as energy source to cover the energetic and nutritional postnatal demands in PT and T in a starved state. The increased abundances of mTOR-associated signal-ing factors and muscle-specific ligase mRNA indicate a greater rate of protein turnover in muscles of PT and T in a starved state. Elevated plasma concentra-tions of several AA may result from enhanced muscle proteolysis and impaired conversion to glucose in the liver of PT calves.

However, by using porous PbO2 anodes that have a three-dimensional architecture, the efficiency of the process can be significantly upgraded. In the current study, carbon felt (CF) with a highly porous structure and a conventional planar graphite sheet (G) were used as electrode substrate for PbO2 anodes. Both CF/beta-PbO2 and G/beta-PbO2 anodes were prepared by the anodic deposition method. The main properties of the electrodes were characterized by XRD, EDX-mapping, FESEM, and BET-BJH techniques. The electrocatalytic degradation of diuron using three-dimensional porous CF/beta-PbO2 anode was modeled and optimized by a rotatable central composite design. After optimizing the process, the ability of porous CF/beta-PbO2 and planar G/beta-PbO2 anodes to degrade and mineralize diuron was compared. The electrocatalytic degradation of the diuron was well described by a quadratic model (R-2 > 0.99). Under optimal conditions, the kinetics of diuron removal using CF/beta-PbO2 anode was 3 times faster than the G/beta-PbO2 anode. The energy consumed for the complete mineralization of diuron using CF/beta-PbO2 anode was 2077 kWh kg(-1) TOC. However, the G/beta-PbO2 anode removed only 65% of the TOC by consuming 54% more energy. The CF/beta-PbO2 had more stability (115 vs. 91 h), larger surface area (1.6287 vs. 0.8565 m(2) g(-1)), and higher oxygen evolution potential (1.89 vs. 1.84 V) compared to the G/beta-PbO2. In the proposed pathways for diuron degradation, the aromatic ring and groups of carbonyl, dimethyl urea, and amide were the main targets for HO center dot radical attacks. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Although nitrification inhibitors (NIs) can decrease N2O emission, this may alter the rate of ammonia (NH3) volatilization, crop yield, and soil CH4 fluxes by directly or indirectly affecting methane-oxidizing bacteria, causing severe environmental and economic damages. Here, we measured the response of gaseous N loss (N2O + NH3) and GHG fluxes (CH4 + direct N2O + indirect N2O) to the intensive application of three different rates of DCD (15 to 45 kg ha(-1)) and DMPP (3 to 9 kg ha(-1)) in N fertilized soils imposed upon six different rice cultivars. N addition increased NH3 volatilization by several orders of magnitude, N2O emission by 7- to 10-fold, and CH4 emission by 2to 4-fold. DCD and DMPP strongly inhibited the N2O emission and, to a lesser extent, CH4 emission but promoted greater NH3 losses in a dose-dependent manner. The soil receiving urea with inhibitors exhibited up to 62.7% additional NH3 volatilization than untreated (inhibitor-free) soils over the rice growth cycle. Considering the estimated indirect N2O emission from deposited NH3, the overall inhibitory effect of nitrification inhibitors (at different application rates) ranged from 17.4% to 36.6% (reduction) for global warming potential and -6.7% to -45.9% (increase) for nitrogen losses. Collectively, our results suggest moderate inhibition of global warming potential but inadequate reduction of gaseous nitrogen losses by NIs, which were outweighed by increased NH3 volatilization. Consequently, NIs appear to be a potentially double-edged sword when targeting to diminish gaseous nitrogen losses from N fertilized soils. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Azapeptide Synthesis Methods for Expanding Side-Chain Diversity for Biomedical Applications	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH												Mimicry of bioactive conformations is critical for peptide-based, medicinal chemistry because such peptidomimetics may augment stability, enhance affinity, and increase specificity. Azapeptides are peptidomimetics in which the alpha-carbon(s) of one or more amino acid residues are substituted by nitrogen. The resulting semicarbazide analogues have been shown to reinforce beta-turn conformation through the combination of lone pair lone pair repulsion of the adjacent hydrazine nitrogen and urea planarity. Substitution of a semicarbazide for an amino amide residue in a peptide may retain biological activity and add benefits such as improved metabolic stability. The applications of azapeptides include receptor ligands, enzyme inhibitors, prodrugs, probes, and imaging agents. Moreover, azapeptides have proven therapeutic utility. For example, the aza-glycinamide analogue of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue Zoladex is a potent long-acting agonist currently used in the clinic for the treatment of prostate and breast cancer. However, the use of azapeptides was hampered by tedious solution-phase synthetic routes for selective hydrazine functionalization. A remarkable stride to overcome this bottleneck was made in 2009 through the introduction of the submonomer procedure for azapeptide synthesis, which enabled addition of diverse side chains onto a common semicarbazone intermediate, providing a means to construct azapeptide libraries by solution and solid-phase chemistry. In brief, aza residues are introduced into the peptide chain using the submonomer strategy by semicarbazone incorporation, deprotonation, N-alkylation, and orthogonal deprotection. Amino acylation of the resulting semicarbazide and elongation gives the desired azapeptide. Since the initial report, a number of chemical transformations have taken advantage of the orthogonal chemistry of semicarbazone residues (e.g., Michael additions and N-arylations). In addition, libraries have been synthesized from libraries by diversification of aza-propargylglycine (e.g., A(3) coupling reactions, [1,3]-dipolar cycloadditions, and S-exo-dig cyclizations) and aza-chloroalkylglycine residues. In addition, oxidation of aza-glycine residues has afforded azopeptides that react in pericyclic reactions (e.g., Diels-Alder and Alder-ene chemistry). The bulk of these transformations of aza-glycine residues have been developed by the Lubell laboratory, which has applied such chemistry in the synthesis of ligands with promising biological activity for treating diseases such as cancer and age-related macular degeneration. Azapeptide analogues of growth hormone-releasing peptide-6 (His-D-Trp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2, GHRP-6) have for example been pursued as ligands of the cluster of differentiation 36 receptor (CD36) and show promising activity for the development of treatments for angiogenesis-related diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, as well as for atherosclerosis. Azapeptides have also been employed to make a series of conformationally constrained second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac) mirnetics that exhibit promising apoptosis-inducing activity in cancer cells. The synthesis of cyclic azapeptide derivatives was used to make an aza scan to study the conformation activity relationships of the anticancer agent cilengitide, cyclo(RGDf-N(Me)V), and its parent counterpart cyclo(RGDfV), which exhibit potency against human tumor metastasis and tumor-induced angiogenesis. Innovations in the synthesis and application of azapeptides will be presented in this Account, focusing on the creation and use of side-chain diversity in medicinal chemistry.

Greenhouse gas emissions from an irrigated cropping rotation with dairy manure utilization in a semiarid climate	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												This long-term study was established to increase knowledge of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from irrigated cropping systems utilizing dairy manure solids and compost in semiarid southern Idaho. The objective of this field study was to determine the effect of synthetic N fertilizer (urea or SuperU [enhanced-efficiency synthetic fertilizer]), composted dairy manure, dairy manure (fall or spring applied), and a control (no fertilizer or manure) on nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) emissions over the growing season. The fertilizer and manure treatments were not applied to alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) (2017) but were applied to corn (Zea mays L.) (2018; except SuperU) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (2019). Cumulative N2O losses over the 3 yr ranged from 2.8 to 5.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1), with the fall and spring manure emitting the greatest amounts of N2O. Emission factors indicated that up to 0.79% of the total N applied was lost as N2O-N during the growing seasons. Cumulative losses of CO2 and CH4 across the rotation were on average 12,170 kg CO2-C ha(-1) and -0.77 kg CH4-C ha(-1), respectively, with no significant differences among the treatments. Major N2O pulses were associated with early-season irrigation events and incorporation of fertilizer and manure, but overall fluxes tended to be the greatest when soil temperatures were higher. Dairy manure and compost applications were also found to cause rapid and significant increases in soil organic carbon (SOC) in the top 30 cm of soil under corn and barley. Despite the fact that manure does cause elevated soil N2O emissions, it should be considered as an alternative to synthetic fertilizer use due to its ability to increase SOC and potentially help reduce the global warming potential.

Stuart; Horwath, William R.; Burger, Martin			Soil nitrous oxide emissions in forage systems fertilized with liquid dairy manure and inorganic fertilizers	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Intensive dairy production generates large amounts of manure, which is typically reused as fertilizer for the production of forage. In the Central Valley of California, application of manure often results in high inputs of N and labile organic C, a combination that can lead to large nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The present study included dairy forage production fields at three dairies with a range of soil textures. Liquid manure from lagoons was applied in surface irrigation water in addition to inorganic N fertilizers. Nitrogen inputs, N2O emissions, crop N removal, soil inorganic N, moisture, and temperature were assessed over two summer corn and one winterforage seasons at each dairy. Between 0.76 and 1.30% of the applied total N was emitted as N2O annually. A significant portion of the N2O emissions was explained by high soil moisture, soil inorganic N, and soil temperature, as shown by multiple regression analysis. Variability in total N2O emissions and emission patterns was likely due to differences in N management and soil texture. Large single applications of N when crop N uptake potential was low were responsible for the largest N2O emissions, whereas distributing N additions, applied with the irrigation water, over the cropping season resulted in lower emissions. The field study was complemented with laboratory incubations of soil amended with liquid manure and N-15-labeled urea-ammonium-nitrate (UAN) to determine the proportion of liquid xnanure and fertilizer N emitted as N2O. The incubation results showed that liquid manure stimulated the release of N2O originating from fertilizer N. Therefore, liquid manure should not be added to irrigation water following side dress fertilizer N applications. To reduce the risks of N2O emissions and other N losses to the environment, manure and fertilizer N inputs, as well as soil N mineralization, must be accounted for and N supplied in increments according to crop demand.

Yet the mechanism of biochar amendment on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural ecosystems remains unclear. Based on a 6-year long-term biochar amendment experiment, we applied a dual isotope (N-15-O-18) labeling technique with tracing transcriptional genes to differentiate the contribution of nitrifler nitrification (NN), nitrifler denitrification (ND), nitrification-coupled denitrification (NCD) and heterotrophic denitrification (HD) pathway to N2O production. Then the field experiment provided quantitative data on dynamic N2O emissions, soil mineral N and key functional marker gene abundances during the wheat growing season. By using N-15-O-18 isotope, biochar decreased N2O emission derived from ND (by 45-94%), HD (by 35-46%) and NCD (by 30-64%) compared to the values under N application. Biochar increased the relative contribution of NN to total N2O production as evidenced by the increase in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, but did not influence the cumulative NN-derived N2O. The field experiment found that the majority of the N2O emissions peaked following fertilization, in parallel with soil NH4+ and nitrite dynamics. Soil N2O emissions during the wheat growing stage were effectively decreased (by 38-48%) by biochar amendment. Based on the correlation analyses and random forest analysis in both microcosm and field experiments, the decrease in nitrite concentration (by 62-65%) and increase in N2O consumption were mainly responsible for net N2O mitigation, as evidenced by the decrease in the ratios of nitrite reductase genes/transcripts (nirS, nirK and fungal nirK) and N2O reductase gene/transcripts (nosZI and nosZII). Based on the extrapolation from microcosm to field, biochar significantly mitigated N2O emissions by weakening the ND processes, since NCD and HD contributed little during the N2O emission "peaks" following urea fertilization. Therefore, emphasis should be put on the ND process and nitrite accumulation during N2O emission peaks and extrapolated to all agroecosystems. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The complex catalysts formed by iron recovery from the bauxite residue (red mud) were restructured with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to generate mesopores with surface-active sites (FeOH) for efficient H2O2 catalysis. Further, 95.2% SO2 and 88.6% NO were removed from flue gas under the operation conditions where SO2 concentration was 2000 ppm, NO concentration was 500 ppm, O-2 concentration was 7%, CO2 concentration was 10%, catalytic temperature was 140 degrees C, H2O2 feeding rate was 1.5 mL/h, and the total gas flow rate was 1.5 L/min. The results suggested that the catalytic performance is closely related to the structure of support ATP, which was elucidated by a series of experiments in different Fe loadings and BET characterization. From electron spin resonance (ESR) results, H2O2 generally decompose not only into the (OH)-O-center dot free radical by iron oxide but also into (HOO)-H-center dot and related reactive oxygen species. According to the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), the content of FeOH and lattice oxygen in the modified ATP catalyst played an important role in the adsorption of H2O2 on the protonated surface of the low-acid catalyst. Furthermore, the rational catalytic mechanism of catalyst/H2O2 at low and high temperatures (corresponding to 140 and 200 degrees C) was proposed by transient response experiments.

However, the influences of cover crops incorporation on paddy soil methanotrophic community structure have not been fully understood. In this study, the impacts of two winter cover crops (Chinese milk vetch (Astragalus sinicus L.) and ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), representing leguminous and non-leguminous cover crops, respectively) on community structure and abundance of methanotrophs were evaluated by using PCR-DGGE (polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and real-time PCR technology in a double-rice cropping system from South China. Four treatments were established in a completely randomized block design: 1) double-rice cropping without nitrogen fertilizer application, CK; 2) double-rice cropping with chemical nitrogen fertilizer application (200 kg ha(-1) urea for entire double-rice season), CF; 3) Chinese milk vetch cropping followed by double-rice cultivation with Chinese milk vetch incorporation, MV; 4) ryegrass cropping followed by double-rice cultivation with ryegrass incorporation, RG. Results showed that cultivating Chinese milk vetch and ryegrass in fallow season decreased soil bulk density and increased rice yield in different extents by comparison with CK. Additionally, methanotrophic bacterial abundance and community structure changed significantly with rice growth. Methanotrophic bacterial pmoA gene copies in four treatments were higher during late-rice season (3.18x10(7) to 10.28x10(7) copies g(-1) dry soil) by comparison with early-rice season (2.1x10(7) to 9.62x10(7) copies g(-1) dry soil). Type I methanotrophs absolutely predominated during early-rice season. However, the advantage of type I methanotrophs kept narrowing during entire double-rice season and both types I and II methanotrophs dominated at later stage of late-rice.

Bifunctional N-doped graphene Ti and Co nanocomposites for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions	RENEWABLE ENERGY												Developing efficient, durable, and low cost catalysts based on earth-abundant elements for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for renewable energy conversion and energy storage devices. We report herein a simple one-pot procedure for the synthesis of non-precious metals N-doped graphene composites employing urea as nitrogen source, and their application as bifunctional catalysts for both the ORR and OER in alkaline environment. In this study, the effects of the addition of Ti and Co on the structure and performance of the N-doped graphene composites are investigated. The incorporation of Ti leads to a composite with both anatase and rutile TiO2 crystalline phases as well as Ti3+ species stabilized upon hybridization with N-doped reduced graphene oxide. The ORR onset potential for the Ti-based composite is 0.85 V (vs. RHE) and the number of electrons transferred is 3.5, showing superior stability than Pt/C after accelerated potential cycling in alkaline solution. However, this composite shows low activity and stability for the OER. On the other hand, the composite consisting of metallic Co and Co3O4 nanocrystals grown on N-doped reduced graphene oxide exhibits the best performance as bifunctional catalyst, with ORR and OER onset potentials of 0.95 V and 1.51 V (vs. RHE), respectively, and a number of electrons transferred of 3.6 (ORR). The results reveal the presence of important structural features such as metallic Co as the predominant crystalline component, amorphous Co3O4 phase and the coordination of Co-N-doped graphene. All of them seem to be fundamental for the high activity and stability towards ORR and OER. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Then a series of epoxy resin (EP) impregnated reinforced wood samples were prepared by combining PPBMBA to improve the dimensional stability and flame retardancy of wood. Differential scanning calorimetry results showed that the curing ability of PPBMBA to EP formulations is equivalent to that of industrial amine curing agents, while simultaneously being flame retardant and environmentally friendly. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation found that the cured EP composite was widely distributed in the wood. Besides, the water uptake rate and volumetric swelling (S) of the impregnated wood sample W-EP-0.10 were 59.8% and 67.8% lower than that of pure wood respectively, while the anti-swelling efficiency (ASE) value was as high as 67.7%. The parallel-to-grain compression strength (CS) of the W-EP-0.10 was increased by up to 78.3% compared to that of pure wood, while the limiting oxygen index increased from 21.7% to 26.8%, and UL 94 reached V-0 level. TGA-FTIR and SEM analysis demonstrated that the thermal stability and flame retardancy of the impregnated wood samples were improved by generating non-flammable gases and forming an insulating char layer synergistically. From a practical standpoint, this work has significant engineering application value for the development of value-added wood products with high-efficiency fire safety and dimensional stability from relatively low-cost wood.						guo, chuigen/0000-0002-8387-3012													1042-7147	1099-1581				OCT	2022	33	10					3249	3262		10.1002/pat.5776	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pat.5776		JUN 2022											WOS:000818562200001

Objectives: The current study aimed to compare the effect of normal saline as a common crystalloid in kidney transplant surgery to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia and sodium bicarbonate on the metabolic acidosis rate after renal transplantation. Methods: A total of 40 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and candidates receiving renal transplant from a living donor referring to the kidney transplantation department of a University affiliated hospital, Tehran, Iran, that meeting the inclusion criteria of this study, were randomly assigned to the intervention group, who were treated with sodium bicarbonate, and the control group, who were treated with normal saline. The primary outcomes measured in this study were acidosis biomarkers including BE, HCO3, PaCO2, and PH and the secondary outcomes included some inflammatory biomarkers and some renal function biomarkers. Results: The mean +/- standard deviation of age in the intervention and control groups was 44.4 +/- 12.4 and 40.0 +/- 13.0, respectively (P = 0.01). A total of 29 of the participants were male (14 in the intervention group and 15 in the control group), and 11 of them (six in the intervention group and five in the control group) were female. The mean +/- standard deviation of change in the concentration of PH, BE, HCO3, and PaCO2 in the intervention and control groups was 0.01 +/- 0.1 and -0.08 +/- 0.1 (P < 0.001); 0.61 +/- 4.2 and -3.8 +/- 2.6 (P < 0.001); 0.36 +/- 2.9 and -2.67 +/- 2.1 (P: 0.001); and 0.8 +/- 5.4 and 1.4 +/- 5.3 (P: 0.799), respectively.

Concomitantly, the discovery of liporegulatory functions of certain short-chain fatty acids has generated interest in their clinical applications. In particular, butyric acid (BA) and its derivative, 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA), which afford health benefits against lipid disorders while being generally well tolerated by animals and humans have been assessed clinically. This review examines the evidence from cell, animal and human studies pertaining to the lipid-regulating effects of BA and PBA, their molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential. Collectively, the evidence supports the view that intakes of BA and PBA benefit lipid homeostasis across biological systems. We reviewed the evidence that BA and PBA downregulate de novo lipogenesis, ameliorate lipotoxicity, slow down atherosclerosis progression, and stimulate fatty acid beta-oxidation. Central to their mode of action, BA appears to function as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor while PBA acts as a chemical chaperone and/or a HDAC inhibitor. Areas of further inquiry include the effects of BA and PBA on adipogenesis, lipolysis and apolipoprotein metabolism.

J	Ji, Y; Conrad, R; Xu, H				Ji, Yang; Conrad, Ralf; Xu, Hua			Responses of archaeal, bacterial, and functional microbial communities to growth season and nitrogen fertilization in rice fields	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS												Fertilization provides excess N to soil microorganisms, thus possibly affecting soil microbial abundance, activity, and community composition during rice cultivation. The abundance and diversity of archaeal, bacterial, and functional microbial communities in rice soils upon different N fertilization regimes (no fertilizer, urea, and controlled-release fertilizer) were investigated by sampling four seasonal growth stages (seedling, tillering, vegetative, maturing) under field conditions. The abundance of bacteria was significantly affected by fertilization and seasonal time, while that of the archaea was not significantly affected. Analysis of terminal restriction fragment polymorphism (T-RFLP) of 16S rRNA genes showed no effect of N fertilization on the archaeal and bacterial community composition, but changes with plant growth time. This result was confirmed by the patterns of pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The function of the methanogenic microbial community was assayed at maturing plant growth stage by determining CH4 production rates and stable isotope fractionation in the absence and presence of methyl fluoride, an inhibitor of acetoclastic methanogenesis. N fertilization had a pronounced effect on the CH4 production rate but not on the pathway of CH4 formation. Additionally, the abundance of functional microbial communities related to CH4 and N2O emissions was measured by qPCR of functional genes. Similarly to the taxonomic composition, rice growth season showed a significant effect on the abundance of the functional microbial communities represented by the mcrA, pmoA, nirK, nirS, and nosZ genes, while N addition had usually no significant effect. A similar result was also obtained by correlation analysis between CH4 and N2O emission rates and abundances of the functional microbial gene copies. In summary, rice growth time had pronounced effects on abundance, composition, and function of microbial communities in the rice soil, while the effect of N fertilization was negligible on the level of both specific functional genes and taxonomic 16S rRNA genes.					j, y/KSM-2723-2024														0178-2762	1432-0789				JAN	2020	56	1					81	95		10.1007/s00374-019-01404-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-019-01404-4		OCT 2019											WOS:000490213400001

Methods: Effects of dencichine on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced oxidative damage in HK-2 renal cells were assessed by CCK-8 method. Forty streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats with kidney injury were randomly divided into negative control group, three doses of dencichine (40, 80 and 160 mg/kg) groups. Blood biochemical and kidney related indexes as well adrenal morphological changes, apoptosis and autophagy related markers of diabetic rats were measured. Results: Cell viability of HK-2 cells with oxidative damage induced by H2O2 was significantly improved by dencichine with 160 mu g/mL for 43.7% and 320 mu g/mL for 52.9% compared with control. Moreover, the decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased intracellular antioxidant enzymes including GPX1, SOD2 and GSH were showed in dencichine groups. In addition, incubation of dencichine in HK-2 cells promoted the increase of p-AMPK, BCL2, LC3, decreased activation of p-mTOR, BAX and Caspase 3. Chronic treatment of dencichine improved the STZ-induced diabetic characteristics of model rats. Further histopathological examination of renal tissues revealed 12-week treatment of dencichine effectively improved the morphology of nephropathy in diabetic rats. Moreover, dencichine also ameliorated excessive oxidation stress, down-regulated renal cell apoptosis and fibrosis related proteins, thereby protected renal tissues in diabetic rats. Conclusion: Dencichine ameliorated STZ-induced kidney injury mainly through inhibiting oxidative stress, reducing renal fibrosis, increasing autophagy, and reducing the renal cell apoptosis related proteins to protect nephrocytes and decrease renal tissue damage.

Previous studies focused only on short-term, high-dose exposure in vivo, or in vitro on female reproductive toxicity, which cannot accurately simulate the real human exposure scenario. The present study aims to explore NP toxicity and the underlying mechanisms of chronic low-dose NP exposure (500 mu g/kg.bw/day, for 8 weeks) in the reproductive system of female rats. The results indicated that NP exposure caused female reproductive toxicity, including alterations in serum 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) levels, endometria hyperplasia, altered oogenesis and significant changes in the metabolic profile observed in urine, serum, uterus and ovary. Furthermore, expression of the energy-sensitive proteins carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPTI), adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) were found to be down-regulated in uterus under NP exposure, which suggested the impaired fatty acid oxidation. Accordingly, a comprehensive metabolomics study in key reproductive tissues and body fluids revealed that 12 metabolites were associated with energy metabolism as potential biomarkers for the evaluation of low toxicity at early stages, with L-carnitines being the most representative ones. The present findings provide evidence that chronic low-dose NP exposure can significantly disrupt energy homeostasis in females, thus offering further insights into NP reproductive toxicity.

HLB is threatening citrus production worldwide, and there is no cure for infected trees. Management strategies targeting diseased trees at different stages of colonization by Las are needed for sustainable citrus production in HLB-endemic regions. We evaluated the effect of the combinations of plant defense elicitors, nitrogen (N) fertilizer, and compost on mildly diseased trees. We tested thermotherapy on severely diseased trees and assessed tree protectors to prevent feeding by ACP, thus preventing Las from being transmitted to new plantings that replaced HLB-moribund trees. After four applications over two consecutive growing seasons we found that the combination of compost, urea, and plant defense elicitors beta-aminobutyric acid, plus ascorbic acid and potassium phosphite with or without salicylic acid, slowed down the progression of HLB and reduced disease severity by approximately 18%, compared with the untreated control. Our data showed no decline in fruit yield, indeed treatment resulted in a higher yield compared with the untreated control. Thermotherapy treatment (55 degrees C for 2 min) exhibited a suppressive effect on growth of Las and progress of HLB in severely diseased trees for 2 to 3 months after treatment. The tree protectors prevented feeding by ACP, and therefore young replant trees remained healthy and free from infection by Las over the 2-year duration of the experiment. Taken together, these results may contribute to a basis for developing a targeted approach to control HLB based on stage of host colonization, application of plant defense elicitors, N fertilizer, compost, thermotherapy, and tree protectors. There is potential to implement these strategies in conjunction with other disease control measures to contribute to sustainable citrus production in HLB-endemic regions.

Ethanol, which is high in H-2, can easily be derived from renewable biomass sources, whereas; glycerol is a by-product of biodiesel expected to be surplus in the coming years. Several catalytic reforming routes involving biomass such as steam, CO2, auto thermal, partial oxidation and aqueous-phase reforming can produce syngas or H-2. Bimetallic catalysis is one of the potential solutions to reduce carbon formation and catalysts deactivation in reforming processes since it can produce more stable catalysts from the synergistic effect of the combined metals. There are many reviews on catalyst designs and reaction pathways reported in the literature; nevertheless, comparative literature is lacking on the metal configuration of bimetallic catalyst in biomass reforming particularly for ethanol and glycerol reforming reactions. Therefore, studies linked with the synergistic effects of various bi-metal combinations of catalysts used in biomass reforming processes have been reviewed in the paper. Moreover, the study provides data for the application of bimetallic catalyst for industrial biomass processes. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To accomplish this, morphologically tailored TiO2 nanorod (TNR) and hydrogen-treated TNR (H-TNR) array photoanodes are placed in an anode cell and Pt foils are located in a cathode cell, while a middle cell containing saline water (0.17 M NaCl) faces these cells through anion and cation exchange membranes, respectively. Upon irradiation by simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm(-2)), the photogeneration of charge carriers initiates the transport of chloride and sodium in the middle cell to the anode and cathode cells, respectively, leading to the desalination of saline water. The chloride in the anode cell is converted to reactive chlorine species (RCS), which effectively decompose urea to N-2 as a primary product (>80%), while the sodium in the cathode cell accelerates the H-2 production from water with a Faradaic efficiency of similar to 80%. The PEC performance of the H-TNR photoanodes is superior to that of the TNR in the anodic and cathodic processes because of the reduced charge transfer resistance and sub-nanosecond charge transfer kinetics (similar to 0.19 ns), leading to a specific energy consumption of 4.4 kW h m(-3) for 50% desalination, with an energy recovery of similar to 0.8 kW h m(-3). The hybrid system is found to operate for a period of similar to 60 h with natural seawater, and virtually all the photoanodes are shown to be capable of driving the hybrid process. Although tested as a proof-of-concept, the present technology opens up a novel field involving a sunlight-water-energy nexus, promising high efficiency desalination and the desalination-driven remediation of water with simultaneous H-2 production.

The influence of D-ribose ingestion and fitness level on performance and recovery	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION												Background: Skeletal muscle adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels are severely depleted during and following prolonged high intensity exercise. Recovery from these lower ATP levels can take days, which can affect performance on subsequent days of exercise. Untrained individuals often suffer the stress and consequences of acute, repeated bouts of exercise by not having the ability to perform or recovery sufficiently to exercise on subsequent days. Conversely, trained individuals may be able to recover more quickly due to their enhanced metabolic systems. D-Ribose (DR) has been shown to enhance the recovery in ATP; however, it is not known if recovery and performance can be benefitted with DR ingestion. Therefore, this study was designed to determine what influence DR might have on muscular performance, recovery, and metabolism during and following a multi-day exercise regimen. Methods: The study was a double blind, crossover study in 26 healthy subjects compared 10 g/day of DR to 10 g/day of dextrose (DEX, control). All subjects completed 2 days of loading with either DR or DEX, followed by 3 additional days of supplementation and during these 3 days of supplementation, each subject underwent 60 min of high intensity interval exercise in separate daily sessions, which involved cycling (8 min of exercise at 60% and 2 min at 80% VO(2)max), followed by a 2 min power output (PO) test. Subjects were divided into two groups based on peak VO2 results, lower VO2 (LVO2) and higher peak VO2 (HVO2). Results: Mean and peak PO increased significantly from day 1 to day 3 for the DR trial compared to DEX in the LVO2 group. Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and creatine kinase (CK) were significantly lower for DR than DEX in the LVO2 group. No differences in PO, RPE, heart rate, CK, blood urea nitrogen, or glucose were found between either supplement for the HVO2 group. Conclusion: DR supplementation in the lower VO2 max group resulted in maintenance in exercise performance, as well as lower levels of RPE and CK. Unlike no observed benefits with DEX supplementation.																			1550-2783					DEC 20	2017	14								47	10.1186/s12970-017-0205-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0205-8								29296106					WOS:000418699300001

The optimal conditions by using response surface methodology (RSM) were established as follows: the supplement of lipase, 23.55 mg, the reaction temperature, 59.4 degrees C and the molar ratio of urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) to CHN, 1.31:1, under which the yield of PCL and number-average molar mass (Mn) at a high CHN concentration of 1.25 M were 96.5% and 2912, respectively. The one-pot ROP consists three steps: first, ethyl acetate (EtOAc) reacts with UHP to generate peracetic acid catalyzed by lipase; then, CHN is lactonized to E-caprolactone (CL) with peracetic acid in situ generated in nonenzymatic, and acetic acid formed reacts with UHP to form peracetic acid; finally, CL suffers from enzymatic ROP to in situ generate PCL. There are three factors contributing to the high yield: cross-linked immobilized lipase employed, the supplement of lipase added in step 3 of ROP and optimal conditions adopted. The initial concentration of UHP was reduced from 2.5 M to 1.625 M owing to acetic acid reacting with UHP to yield peracetic acid which can help obtain a high yield of PCL. A kinetic model for this one-pot three-step enzymatic ROP reaction was developed, which fitted the observed data well. The enzymatic reaction mediated by lipase may obey the ping-pong mechanism with substrate inhibition of UHP and acetic acid, while the nonenzymatic reaction may obey a power law. Using the kinetic model, the contribution of the reaction of UHP with EtOAc and acetic acid to the yield of peracetic acid can be distinguished, contributing to better comprehend the reaction process.					zhang, Yuanyuan/AAQ-8238-2021; sun, yangjian/HLX-1740-2023; Ren, Wenjie/JFK-8231-2023; liu, junhong/ABA-6248-2020	gao, xin/0000-0003-1924-1106													0032-3861	1873-2291				NOV 3	2020	208								122906	10.1016/j.polymer.2020.122906	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2020.122906													WOS:000579906400006

Transcriptomic analyses suggest a dominant role of insulin in the coordinated control of energy metabolism and ureagenesis in goat liver	BMC GENOMICS												Background The ureagenesis plays a central role in the homeostatic control of nitrogen metabolism. This process occurs in the liver, the key metabolic organ in the maintenance of energy homeostasis in the body. To date, the understanding of the influencing factors and regulators of ureagenesis in ruminants is still poor. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between energy metabolism and ureagenesis and detect the direct regulators of ureagenesis in the liver by using RNA-seq technology. Results Eighteen four-month-old male goats were divided into two groups randomly and received a diet containing 10% (LNFC group, n = 9) or 30% non-fiber carbohydrate (MNFC group, n = 9), respectively, for four weeks. The global gene expression analysis of liver samples showed that, compared with a LNFC diet, the MNFC diet promoted the expression of genes required for synthesis of fatty acid and glycerol, whereas it suppressed those related to fatty acid oxidation, gluconeogenesis from amino acids and ureagenesis. Additionally, gene expression for rate-limiting enzymes of ureagenesis were highly correlated to the gene expression of key enzymes of both fatty acid synthesis and glycerol synthesis (Spearman correlation coefficient > 0.8 and p < 0.05). In the differentially expressed signaling pathways related to the endocrine system, the MNFC diet activated the insulin and PPAR signaling pathway, whereas it suppressed the leptin-JAK/STAT signaling pathway, compared with the LNFC diet. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR analyses of 40 differentially expressed genes confirmed the RNA-seq results (R-2 = 0.78). Conclusion Our study indicated that a dietary NFC-induced increase of energy supply promoted lipid anabolism and decreased ureagenesis in the caprine liver. By combining our results with previously published reports, insulin signaling can be suggested to play the dominant role in the coordinated control of hepatic energy metabolism and ureagenesis.

Trevor; Cam, Le Minh			Graphitic carbon nitride supported silver nanoparticles (AgNPs/g-C3N4): synthesis and photocatalytic behavior in the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid	RSC ADVANCES												Graphitic carbon nitride supported silver nanoparticles (AgNPs/g-C3N4) with 1%, 3%, and 5% AgNPs were successfully synthesized by an "ex situ" method with ultrasound of a mixture of AgNP solution and g-C3N4. The AgNP solution was prepared by chemical reduction with trisodium citrate, and g-C3N4 was synthesized from the urea precursor. The supported nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen adsorption-desorption (BET), Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots. The visible light-driven photocurrent measurement was performed by three on-off cycles of intermittent irradiation. The analyses show that AgNPs were evenly dispersed on g-C3N4, and have sizes ranging from 40 to 50 nm. The optical properties of the AgNPs/g-C3N4 material were significantly enhanced due to the plasmonic effect of AgNPs. The photocatalytic activity of catalysts was evaluated by 2,4-D degradation under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). In the reaction conditions: pH 2.2; C-o (2,4-D) 40 ppm; a m/v ratio of 0.5 g L-1, AgNPs/g-C3N4 materials exhibit superior photocatalytic activity compared to the pristine g-C3N4. The studies on the influence of free radicals and photogenerated holes, h(+), show that (OH)-O-center dot, O-2(center dot)-, and h(+) play decisive roles in the photocatalytic activity of AgNPs/g-C3N4. The TOC result indicates the minimal toxicity of the by-products formed during the 2,4-D degradation. In addition, the AgNPs/g-C3N4 catalytic activity under direct sunlight irradiation was similar to that under artificial UV irradiation. Based on these results, a possible mechanism is proposed to explain the enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability of AgNPs/g-C3N4. Theoretical calculations on the interaction between 2,4-D and g-C3N4, Ag/g-C3N4 was also performed. The calculated results show that the adsorption of 2,4-D on Ag-modified g-C3N4 is significantly more effective compared to pristine g-C3N4.

This study quantified the impact of N application and sheep grazing on the N2O and CH4 emissions from a subtropical Ferralsol under an integrated crop-livestock (ICL) management system. In a long-term experiment in southern Brazil, gaseous fluxes were measured during a year-long cycle of ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) plus oats (Avena sativa) winter pasture and a summer crop of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris). Three rates of urea-nitrogen (0, 75, and 150 kg ha(-1)) were applied to the winter-pasture, which was subjected to two sheep grazing levels (continuously grazed, and ungrazed). The experiment had a complete randomized block design with three replicates. Soil N2O and CH4 fluxes were measured with closed static-chambers (0.20 m high x 0.25 m in diameter). Nitrous oxide emission peaks occurred 28 days after N application and increased with N application rate. Accordingly, the cumulative N2O emissions averaged across grazed and ungrazed treatments increased from 0.45 kg ha(-1) in the control soil to 1.78 and 2.10 kg ha(-1) after application of 75 and 150 kg ha(-1), respectively. The N2O emission factors were 1.7 and 1.1 % when the N rates were 75 and 150 kg ha(-1), respectively. The cumulative average N2O emission for all N rates was 2.09 kg ha(-1) in ungrazed pasture, but it was reduced by 62 % with grazing to 0.80 kg ha(-1), perhaps because of a possible denitrification of N2O to N-2 associated with soil compaction from trampling. Overall, fertilizer-N is an important source of N2O from soil under ICL based on sheep grazing, with emission factors consistent with the IPCC's default of 1 % (0.3-3.0 %). Grazing reduced the emission of soil N2O, but the underlying cause of that reduction needs to be better understood.

The g-C3N4/CDs/Fe(II) composite was prepared through thermal polymerization of urea and citric acid, followed by impregnation with Fe(II). The fabricated composite was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherms. The results demonstrated that CDs were embedded in the interlayer of g-C3N4 while Fe(II) was grafted onto the surface. The degradation activity of the composite for methylene blue (MB) was systematically investigated. The optimal content of CDs was confirmed to be 3% and a higher Fe(II) content was observed to lead to a greater degradation rate. However, in order to avoid high iron leaching, which may lead to the precipitation of iron, exorbitant Fe(II) content must be deprecated. Besides, the loading of Fe(II) on the g-C3N4/CDs composite disrupts the acidic restriction of a typical Fenton reaction, leading to the removal of 57.9%-66.8% MB in 1 h, in the pH range of 3-9, and in the presence of 0.5 g/L catalyst and 1 mM H2O2. Interestingly, homogeneous cycled reactions driven by possibly dissolved Fe-C complex showed similar decomposition rates of H2O2 in the filtered solution even after 7 cycles with fixed concentration of dissolved Fe. Hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) and superoxide radical (O-2(center dot-)) were identified to be the major reactive species through electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis, which were generated in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous reactions. Therefore, a tentative mechanism based on the above results was proposed. In summary, the ternary g-C3N4/CDs/Fe(II) composite was proven to serve as an efficient Fenton-like catalyst, which could be applied in a wide range of pH.					sun, yuan/KBD-3926-2024; Liu, Zhongda/GWB-9927-2022	Yang, Miao/0000-0003-4522-772X; Liu, Zhongda/0000-0002-6046-2122													1932-7447	1932-7455				NOV 7	2019	123	44					26921	26931		10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b06774	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b06774													WOS:000495772100021

When the aggregates are subsequently fermented by the microbiota, they can generate potentially harmful compounds for the colonic mucosa. Objective: This study evaluated the quantity of bovine meat protein escaping digestion in the human small intestine and the metabolic fate of exogenous nitrogen, depending on cooking processes. Methods: Sixteen volunteers (5 women and 11 men; aged 28 +/- 8 y) were equipped with a double lumen intestinal tube positioned at the ileal level. They received a test meal exclusively composed of 120 g of intrinsically N-15-labeled bovine meat, cooked either at 55 degrees C for 5 min (n = 8) or at 90 degrees C for 30 min (n = 8). Ileal effluents and blood and urine samples were collected over an 8-h period dfter the meal ingestion, and N-15 enrichments were measured to assess the digestibility of meat proteins and the transfer of dietary nitrogen into the metabolic pools. Results: Proteins tended to be less digestible for the meat cooked at 90 degrees C for 30 min than at 55 degrees C for 5 min (90.1% +/- 2.1% vs. 94.1% +/- 0.7% of ingested N; P = 0.08). However, the particle number and size in ileal digests did not differ between groups. The appearance of variable amounts of intact fibers was observed by microscopy. The kinetics of 15N appearance in plasma proteins, amino acids, and urea were similar between groups. The amount of exogenous nitrogen lost through deamination did not differ between groups (21.2% +/- 0.8% of ingested N).

O.			Effect of Substituting Fish Oil with Camelina Oil on Growth Performance, Fatty Acid Profile, Digestibility, Liver Histology, and Antioxidative Status of Red Seabream (Pagrus major)	ANIMALS												Simple Summary The shortage of natural resources, prices, and high demand for fish oil has encouraged the use of non-traditional ingredients in aquafeed. The search for an alternative lipid source in aquafeeds has seen terrestrial vegetable oils at the epicenter of various flagship aqua-feed research. Herein, we investigated the effects of substituting fish oil (FO) with camelina oil (CO) on growth performance, fatty acid profile, digestibility, liver histology, and antioxidative status of red seabream (Pagrus major). After 56 days of the feeding trial, the results suggested that FO can be replaced with CO in the feeds of farmed red seabream without compromising growth, blood chemistry, digestibility, and overall health status. A 56-day feeding trial to evaluate the responses of red seabream (initial weight: 1.8 +/- 0.02 g) to the substitution of fish oil (FO) with camelina oil (CO) at different ratios was conducted. The control diet formulated at 46% CP (6F0C) contained only FO without CO; from the second to the fifth diet, the FO was substituted with CO at rates of 5:1 (5F1C), 4:2 (4F2C), 3:3 (3F3C), 2:4 (2F4C), and 0:6 (0F6C). The results of the present study showed that up to full substitution of FO with CO showed no significant effect on growth variables BW = 26.2 g-28.3 g), body weight gain (BWG = 1275.5-1365.3%), specific growth rate (SGR = 4.6-4.7), feed intake (FI = 25.6-27.8), feed conversion ratio (FCR = 1.0-1.1), biometric indices condition factor (CF = 2.2-2.4), hepatosomatic index (HSI = 0.9-1.1), viscerasomatic index (VSI = 7.5-9.5), and survival rates (SR = 82.2-100) with different FO substitution levels with CO. Similarly, there were no significant differences (p < 0.05) found in the whole-body composition except for the crude lipid content, and the highest value was observed in the control group (291 g/kg) compared to the other groups FO5CO1 (232 k/kg), FO4CO2 (212 g/kg), FO2CO4 (232 g/kg) and FO0CO6 (244 g/kg). Blood chemistry levels were not influenced in response to test diets: hematocrit (36-33%), glucose (Glu = 78.3-71.3 mg/dL), total protein (T-pro = 3.1-3.8 g/dL), total cholesterol (T-Chol = 196.0-241 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN = 9.0-14.6 mg/dL), total bilirubin (T-Bil = 0.4-0.5 mg/dL), triglyceride (TG = 393.3-497.6 mg/dL), alanine aminotransferase test (ALT = 50-65.5 UL/L), aspartate aminotransferase test (AST = 38-69.3 UL/L). A remarkable modulation was observed in catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the liver, as CAT and SOD values were lower with the complete FO substitution with CO (0F6C), and the highest values were observed in the control and (4F2C). This study indicates that red seabream may have the ability to maintain LC-PUFAs between tissues and diets, and CO substitution of FO could improve both lipid metabolism and oxidation resistance as well as maintain digestibility. In conclusion, dietary FO can be replaced up to 100% or 95% by CO in the diets of red seabream as long as n-3 HUFA, EPA, and DHA are incorporated at the recommended level.

Therefore, in this work, CeO2-based support was incorporation by Sm ion in order to produce the oxygen vacancy defect site. Ce1-xSmxO2 (x = 0.010, 0.050, and 0.10 at%) mixed oxide supports were synthesized by urea gelation to investigate the role of Sm addition into ceria-based support on surface, structural and redox properties which was altered to their catalytic activities. XRD and Raman spectroscopy results indicated the incorporation of Sm3+ into CeO2 lattice which gave rise to unit cell enlargement and led to structural distortions inside CeO2 which produced strain and unbalanced charge and then finally facilitated oxygen vacancy formation. XANES and EXAFS results also evidenced the replacement of Sm-3(+) into Ce-4(+) site in CeO2 lattice. H-2-Temperature programmed reduction and temperature-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (under reduction condition) were employed to investigate the reducibility of Ce1-xSmxO2 supports. XANES spectra of Ce L-3 edges displayed lower surface reduction temperature (Ce4+ to Ce3+) which corresponded to H-2-TPR results. The results of catalytic activity tests for water gas shift reaction showed that the activity of 1 wt%Pd/Ce1-xSmxO2 was higher than that of 1 wt%Pd/CeO2. The role of Sm on enhancing WGS reaction rate were to increase CO molecules adsorption by promoting the dispersion of active metal site on catalyst surface and to facilitate the redox cycle between Ce-4+ and Ce3+ of ceria support by oxygen vacancies formation. Therefore, combined these two effects the WGS activities were enhanced. Moreover, by using the results from our previous works together with the results from this work, we can evidence that speeding up the different elementary steps in the reaction mechanism, the WGS rate can also be enhanced.

J	Johannsen, JC; Sorensen, MT; Bruun, TS; Feyera, T				Johannsen, Jakob C.; Sorensen, Martin T.; Bruun, Thomas S.; Feyera, Takele			Dietary protein requirement of hyper-prolific sows in late gestation	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE												This study aimed to determine the protein requirement of hyper-prolific sows in late gestation. Forty-eight multiparous sows were assigned to one of six dietary treatments according to body weight (BW; 287 +/- 5 kg) on d 84 of gestation and parity (3.8 +/- 0.1) and fed 3.3 kg/d from d 84 to 108 of gestation. Five dietary treatments had increasing concentrations of dietary protein [expressed as standardized ileal digestible (SID) lysine (Lys); 3.05 to 6.90 g/kg]. The sixth treatment (high-cAA) had reduced crude protein (CP) relative to Lys concentration and was supplemented with crystalline amino acids (AA), so that the concentration of the supplemented AA matched that of the diet containing 6.90 g/kg of SID Lys and the remaining essential AA matched that of the diet containing 3.05 g/kg of SID Lys. Sow BW and backfat thickness (BF) were measured and blood was sampled on d 84, 96 and 108 of gestation and weekly during lactation. Deuterium oxide was injected on d 84 and 108 of gestation and on d 3 and 28 of lactation to estimate sow body composition. A nitrogen (N) balance was conducted on d 107 of gestation. At the onset of farrowing, colostrum and blood were sampled from the sows and number and birth time of live- and stillborn piglets, and birth weight of liveborn were recorded. Piglets were weighed and colostrum sampled at 12, 24, and 36 h after the onset of farrowing, and thereafter weekly weighing and milk sampling during lactation. From d 84 to 108 of gestation sow BW increased with SID Lys until reaching a plateau at 5.63 g/kg of SID Lys (P = 0.02) and sow BF had a polynomial relationship with SID Lys, which peaked at 4.85 g/kg of SID Lys (P = 0.04). On d 107 of gestation, N retention and utilization increased linearly with SID Lys and reached plateaus at 5.60 (P < 0.001) and 5.07 g/kg of SID Lys (P < 0.01), respectively. Reproductive parameters were not affected by dietary treatments and there were no indications of carry-over effects to lactational performance. During the treatment period, sows fed the high-cAA diet had higher BW (P < 0.01) and body protein (P = 0.02) gain than sows fed 3.05 g/kg of SID Lys and on d 107 of gestation they had reduced excretion of urea and N in urine (P < 0.001 for both) relative to sows fed 6.90 g/kg of SID Lys. Also, compared to any other treatment, the plasma concentration of sows fed the high-cAA diet gradually decreased during the treatment period (P < 0.01), indicating reduced AA oxidation. In conclusion, a SID Lys concentration of 4.85 to 5.07 g/kg (16.0 to 16.7 g/d) from d 84 to 108 of gestation ensures optimal utilization of N and maximizes BF gain in hyper-prolific sows. Piglet and litter birth weight and sow milk yield were unaffected by dietary concentration of SID Lys. Feeding late gestating sows diets with reduced CP relative to Lys and supplemented with crystalline AA, improved N balance, with no indications of impaired reproductive and subsequent lactational performance or reduced maternal gain, suggesting that the AA composition of the high-cAA diet met the sows' requirement for essential AA.

Effects of selenium and vitamin E on performance, physiological response, and selenium balance in heat-stressed sheep	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												Forty-two 7-mo-old Australian Merino wethers were used in a 50-d trial to investigate the effects of Se and vitamin E on the performance and physiological responses of heat-stressed sheep. Sheep were exposed to thermoneutral conditions (maximum = 24 degrees C and minimum = 20 degrees C) for 28 d followed by heat (maximum = 38 degrees C and minimum = 28 degrees C) for 22 d. Hot conditions were imposed between 0700 and 1800 h. Sheep were randomly allocated to diets containing 0.8 mg/kg Se (Sel-Plex), 150 mg/kg vitamin E, or 0.8 mg/kg Se and 150 mg/kg vitamin E for either the duration of the study (50 d) or from d 1 of the hot period until the end of the study. A control group that received no supplemental Se and vitamin E for the duration of the study was included. Feed intake was measured daily and sheep were weighed weekly. Blood samples were collected from all sheep before feeding on d 1, 21, and 49 for measurement of biochemical and enzymatic variables. The concentration of Se was determined in offered and refused feed, feces, urine, water, plasma, liver, and kidneys. Exposure to heat reduced (P < 0.05) DMI by 11.9%, ADG by 198 g, serum concentration of urea nitrogen and Se by 17.8%, and plasma total antioxidant status by 26.4%. During hot conditions, sheep receiving Se and vitamin E supplements for 50 d had reduced (P < 0.05) BW loss and elevated G:F compared to control sheep. Serum Se concentration and the plasma total antioxidant status were greatest in sheep receiving Se and vitamin E supplements for 50 d (P < 0.05). These results indicate that dietary supplementation with Se and vitamin E reduces the adverse effects of a high heat load. Additional studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for these effects.

Ellagic acid (EA) can inhibit the expression of related proteins on the pathway by blocking the nuclear factor kappa-B(NF-kappa B) signaling pathway, inhibit the levels of pro-inflammatory factors interleukin-1 beta(IL-1 beta), interleukin-6(IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha), increase the level of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10, and effectively alleviate inflammatory symptoms. In addition, EA can also reduce the levels of malondialdehyde(MDA) and nitric oxide(NO) in the body, increase the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and catalase(CAT), scavenge oxidative free radicals, inhibit lipid oxidation, and achieve antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects. The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between EA and various inflammatory markers, such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, prostaglandin E2(PGE2), and cyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP), and clarify the mechanism of the cyclooxidase-2(COX-2)/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Combined with the metabolomics analysis, our study revealed the effects of EA on multiple endogenous biomarkers, reflecting the characteristics of a multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway mechanism. Compared to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- treated animals, subsequent administration of EA significantly lowered the LPS-induced rectal temperature increase (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), significantly increased serum SOD and GSH levels (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), and significantly decreased serum MDA, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). In addition, compared to LPS-treated animals, subsequent administration of EA significantly decreased cerebrospinal fluid cAMP and PGE2 levels (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), significantly decreased cAMP, significantly increased 5-HT levels (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), and significantly down-regulated p-NF-kappa B p65 and COX-2 protein levels in the hypothalamus. Subsequent gas chromatography mass spectrometry(GC-MS) metabolite analysis indicated that 12 differential metabolites were detected in serum isolated 4 h after LPS treatment, and 10 differential metabolites were detected in serum collected 7 h after LPS treatment. Next, Pearson correlation analysis was used to systematically characterize the relationship between the identified metabolites and TNF-alpha, IL-6, MDA, SOD, PGE2, and cAMP. The levels of propionic acid, pyridine, and L-valine were up-regulated by EA, which inhibited the expression of MDA, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha and increased the activity of GSH. The levels of inositol, urea, and 2-monopalmitin were down-regulated by EA, which inhibited the expression of MDA, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha, increased the activity of SOD and GSH, reduced the inflammatory response, and alleviated the oxidative stress state. Combined with the results of the metabolic pathway analysis, we suggest that the pathways of the galactose metabolism, synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, as well as ascorbic acid and aldehyde acid metabolism are closely related to the antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of EA. Our study established the relationship between EA and various inflammatory markers, such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, PGE2, and cAMP, and clarified the mechanism of the COX-2/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Combined with the metabolomics analysis, our study revealed the effects of EA on multiple endogenous biomarkers, reflecting the characteristics of a multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway mechanism.																				2218-1989				AUG	2024	14	8							407	10.3390/metabo14080407	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/metabo14080407								39195502					WOS:001307072200001

Intramammary lipopolysaccharide challenge in early- versus mid-lactation dairy cattle: Immune, production, and metabolic responses	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE												Study objectives were to compare the immune response, metabolism, and production following intramammary LPS (IMM LPS) administration in early and mid-lactation cows. Early (E-LPS; n = 11; 20 +/- 4 DIM) and mid- (M-LPS; n = 10; 155 +/- 40 DIM) lactation cows were enrolled in an experiment consisting of 2 periods (P). During P1 (5 d) cows were fed ad libitum and baseline data were collected, including liver and muscle biopsies. At the beginning of P2 (3 d) cows received 10 mL of sterile saline containing 10 mu g of LPS from Escherichia coli O111: B4/ mL into the left rear quarter of the mammary gland, and liver and muscle biopsies were collected at 12 h after LPS. Tissues were analyzed for metabolic flexibility, which measures substrate switching capacity from pyruvic acid to palmitic acid oxidation. Data were analyzed with the MIXED procedure in SAS 9.4. Rectal temperature was assessed hourly for the first 12 h after LPS and every 6 h thereafter for the remainder of P2. All cows developed a febrile response following LPS, but E-LPS had a more intense fever than M-LPS cows (0.7 degrees C at 5 h after LPS). Blood samples were collected at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h after LPS for analysis of systemic inflammation and metabolism parameters. Total serum Ca decreased after LPS (26% at 6 h nadir) but did not differ by lactation stage (LS). Circulating neutrophils decreased, then increased after LPS in both LS, but ELPS had exaggerated neutrophilia (56% from 12 to 48 h) compared with M-LPS. Haptoglobin increased after LPS (15-fold) but did not differ by LS. Many circulating cytokines were increased after LPS, and IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, MCP-1, and IP-10 were further augmented in E-LPS compared with M-LPS cows. Relative to P1, all cows had reduced milk yield (26%) and DMI (14%) on d 1 that did not differ by LS. Somatic cell score increased rapidly in response to LPS regardless of LS and gradually decreased from 18 h onwards. Milk component yields decreased after LPS. However, E-LPS had increased fat (11%) and tended to have increased lactose (8%) yield compared with M-LPS cows throughout P2. Circulating glucose was not affected by LPS. Nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) decreased in E-LPS (29%) but not M-LPS cows. beta-Hydroxybutyrate slightly increased (14%) over time after LPS regardless of LS. Insulin increased after LPS in all cows, but E-LPS had blunted hyperinsulinemia (52%) compared with M-LPS cows. Blood urea nitrogen increased after LPS, and the relative change in BUN was elevated in E-LPS cows compared with M-LPS cows (36% and 13%, respectively, from 9 to 24 h). During P1, metabolic flexibility was increased in liver and muscle in early lactating cows compared with mid-lactation cows, but 12 h after LPS, metabolic flexibility was reduced and did not differ by LS. In conclusion, IMM LPS caused severe immune activation, and E-LPS cows had a more intense inflammatory response compared with M-LPS cows, but the effects on milk synthesis was similar between LS. Some parameters of the E-LPS metabolic profile suggest continuation of metabolic adjustments associated with early lactation to support both a robust immune system and milk synthesis.

Effects of Heat-oxidized Soy Protein Isolate on Growth Performance and Digestive Function of Broiler Chickens at Early Age	ASIAN-AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES												This study was conducted to investigate effects of heat-oxidized soy protein isolate (HSPI) on growth performance, serum biochemical indices, apparent nutrient digestibility and digestive function of broiler chickens. A total of 320 I-day-old Arbor Acres chicks were randomly divided into 4 groups with 8 replicates of 10 birds, receiving diets containing soy protein isolate (SPI, control group) or the same amount of SPI heated in an oven at 100 degrees C for 1, 4, or 8 h, for 21 days, respectively. The results indicated that compared with the control group, body weight gain and feed intake of birds fed diet containing SPI heated for 8 h were significantly lower (p<0.05). Serum urea nitrogen concentration was higher in the broilers fed diet containing SPI heated for 4 or 8 h at d 21 (p<0.05). In contrast, serum glucose content was decreased by HSPI substitution at d 21 (p<0.05). The relative pancreas weight in HSPI groups was higher than that in the control group at d 21 (p<0.05). Meanwhile, the opposite effect was observed for relative weight of anterior intestine and ileum in broilers fed a diet containing SPI heated for 8 h (p<0.05). Birds fed diets containing SPI heated for 4 or 8 h had a decreased lipase activity in anterior intestinal content at d 14 and 21 (p<0.05), respectively. In addition, the same effect was also noted in broilers given diets containing SPI heated for 1 h at d 21 (p<0.05). Similarly, amylase, protease and trypsin activity in anterior intestinal content were lower in broilers fed diets containing SPI heated for 8 h at d 21 (p<0.05). The apparent digestibility of dry matter (DM) from d 8 to 10 and DM, crude protein (CP), and ether extract from d 15 to 17 were lower in broilers fed diets containing SPI heated for 8 h (p<0.05). Besides, birds given diets containing SPI heated for 4 h also exhibited lower CP apparent digestibility from d 15 to 17 (p<0.05).

Complex 1 activates dioxygen to yield the diferric, mu-oxo-bridged complex [(OCO)Fe(py)(mu-O)Fe(O(C=O)O)(py)] (2) that was isolated and fully characterized. In 2, one of the iron-carbene bonds was oxidized to give a urea motif, resulting in an O(C-NHC equivalent to O)O binding site, while the other Fe(OCO) unit remained unchanged. When the reaction is performed at -80 degrees C, an intensively colored, purple intermediate is observed (INT, lambda(max) = 570 nm; epsilon = 5600 mol L-1 cm(-1)). INT acts as a sluggish oxidant, reacting only with easily oxidizable substrates, such as PPh3 or 2-phenylpropionic aldehyde (2-PPA). The identity of INT can be best described as a dinuclear complex containing a closed diamond core motif [(OCO)Fe-IV(mu-O)(2)Fe-IV(OCO)]. This proposal is based on extensive spectroscopic [UV/vis/NIR electronic absorption, Fe-57 Mossbauer, X-band EPR, resonance Raman (rRaman), X-ray absorption, and nuclear resonance vibrational (NRVS)] and computational studies. The conversion of the diiron(II) complex 1 to the oxo diiron(IV) intermediate INT is reminiscent of the O-2 activation process in soluble methane monooxygenases (sMMO). Most importantly, the low reactivity of INT supports the consensus that the [Fe-IV(mu-O)(2)Fe-IV] diamond core in sMMO is kinetically inert and needs to open up to terminal Fe-IV=O cores to react with the strong C-H bonds of methane.

It is not clear how future climate change may affect soil CH4 emissions and related microbial communities. The aim of this study was to determine the interactive effects of a simulated warmer and drier climate scenarios and the application of different nitrogen (N) sources (urea and manure) on CH4 emissions and related microbial community abundance in a vegetable soil. Greenhouses were used to control simulated climate conditions which gave 2.99 degrees C warmer and 6.2% lower water content conditions. The field experiment was divided into two phases. At the beginning of phase II, half of the greenhouses were removed to study possible legacy effects of the simulated warmer and drier conditions. The responses in methanogen and methanotroph abundance to a simulated climate change scenario were determined using real-time PCR. The results showed that the simulated warmer and drier conditions in the greenhouses significantly decreased CH4 emissions largely due to the lower soil moisture content. For the same reason, CH4 emissions of treatments in phase I were much lower than the same treatments in phase II. The abundance of methanotrophs showed a more significant response than methanogens to the simulated climate change scenario, increasing under simulated drier conditions. Methanogenic community abundance remained low, except where manure was applied which provided a source of organic C that stimulated methanogen growth. Soil moisture content was a major driver for methanotroph abundance and strongly affected CH4 emissions. The application of N source decreased CH4 emissions probably because of increased methanotrophic activity. CH4 emissions were positively correlated to methanogenic abundance and negatively correlated to methanotrophic abundance. These results demonstrate that projected future climate change conditions can have a feedback impact on CH4 emissions from the soil by altering soil conditions (particularly soil moisture) and related microbial communities.

Effects of increasing levels of palm kernel meal containing β-mannanase to growing-finishing pig diets on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and pork quality	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE												In this study, we investigated the effects of increasing levels of palm kernel meal (PKM) in diets containing beta-mannanase on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and pork quality in growing-finishing pigs. One hundred twenty pigs [(Yorkshire x Landrace) x Duroc] with 29.68 +/- 0.17 kg BW] were allotted to 5 dietary treatments with 4 pigs per pen and 6 replicates per treatment on the basis of sex and BW. These dietary treatments were: NC (negative control; corn-soybean meal-based diet), PC (positive control; basal diet + 0.10% beta-mannanase), PKM6 (diet containing 6% PKM + 0.10% beta-mannanase), PKM12 (diet containing 12% PKM + 0.10% beta-mannanase), and PKM18 (diet containing 18% PKM + 0.10% beta-mannanase). The BW was linearly decreased as the dietary inclusion level of PKM increased in early finishing phase (linear, P < 0.05) and late finishing phase (linear, P < 0.01). Similarly, ADFI was linearly decreased as the dietary inclusion level of PKM increased in late finishing phase (linear, P < 0.03), and during the entire experimental period (linear, P < 0.01). However, no PKM effect was observed on the G/F ratio. Digestibility of crude protein and crude fiber were linearly decreased when dietary levels of PKM increased (linear, P < 0.05). Moreover, increasing level of PKM in the diet linearly increased fecal nitrogen levels (linear, P < 0.03). Dietary treatment had no adverse effects on plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) levels. Pigs fed diets containing 18% PKM tended to have decreased carcass yield (P < 0.08) as well as increased backfat depth (P < 0.10). Consequently, growing-finishing pigs fed increasing levels of PKM had a linear reduction on growth performance and digestibility. Overall, PKM can be added up to 12% in corn-soybean meal diets supplemented with 0.10% beta-mannanase without detrimental effects on growth performance and pork quality of growing-finishing pigs.

J	Houser, DS; Derous, D; Douglas, A; Lusseau, D				Houser, Dorian S.; Derous, Davina; Douglas, Alex; Lusseau, David			Metabolic response of dolphins to short-term fasting reveals physiological changes that differ from the traditional fasting model	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) typically feed on prey that are high in lipid and protein content and nearly devoid of carbohydrate, a dietary feature shared with other marine mammals. However, unlike fasted-adapted marine mammals that predictably incorporate fasting into their life history, dolphins feed intermittently throughout the day and are not believed to be fasting-adapted. To assess whether the physiological response to fasting in the dolphin shares features with or distinguishes them from those of fasting-adapted marine mammals, the plasma metabolomes of eight bottlenose dolphins were compared between post-absorptive and 24-h fasted states. Increases in most identified free fatty acids and lipid metabolites and reductions in most amino acids and their metabolites were consistent with the upregulation of lipolysis and lipid oxidation and the downregulation of protein catabolism and synthesis. Consistent with a previously hypothesized diabetic-like fasting state, fasting was associated with elevated glucose and patterns of certain metabolites (e.g. citrate, cis-aconitate, myristoleic acid) indicative of lipid synthesis and glucose cycling to protect endogenous glucose from oxidative disposal. Pathway analysis predicted an upregulation of cytokines, decreased cell growth and increased apoptosis including apoptosis of insulin-secreting beta-cells. Metabolomic conditional mutual information networks were estimated for the post-absorptive and fasted states and 'topological modules' were estimated for each using the eigenvector approach to modularity network division. A dynamic network marker indicative of a physiological shift toward a negative energy state was subsequently identified that has the potential conservation application of assessing energy state balance in at-risk wild dolphins.

However, it is challenging to quantify critical load of N input for the alteration of the soil C fluxes, and what factors controlled the changes in soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes under N enrichment. Nine levels of urea addition experiment (0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) were conducted in the needle-broadleaved mixed forest in Changbai Mountain, Northeast China. Soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes were monitored weekly using the static chamber and gas chromatograph technique. Environmental variables (soil temperature and moisture in the 010 cm depth) and dissolved N (NH4+-N, NO3--N, total dissolved N (TDN), and dissolved organic N (DON)) in the organic layer and the 010 cm mineral soil layer were simultaneously measured. High rates of N addition (>= 60 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) significantly increased soil NO3--N contents in the organic layer and the mineral layer by 120%-180% and 56.4%-84.6%, respectively. However, N application did not lead to a significant accumulation of soil NH4+-N contents in the two soil layers except for a few treatments. N addition at a low rate of 10 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) significantly stimulated, whereas high rate of N addition (140 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) significantly inhibited soil CO2 emission and CH4 uptake. Significant negative relationships were observed between changes in soil CO2 emission and CH4 uptake and changes in soil NO3--N and moisture contents under N enrichment. These results suggest that soil nitrification and NO3--N accumulation could be important regulators of soil CO2 emission and CH4 uptake in the temperate needle-broadleaved mixed forest. The nonlinear responses to exogenous N inputs and the critical level of N in terms of soil C fluxes should be considered in the ecological process models and ecosystem management.					hua, fang/B-3590-2009; Li, Xiaoyu/HDN-7540-2022; Yu, Guirui/C-1768-2014	Yu, Guirui/0000-0002-1859-8966													1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2017	79						28	36		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.03.054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.03.054													WOS:000406436000004

To solve this issue, slow-release fertilizer and deep placement of nitrogen fertilizer are recommended, and have been proven effective in improving nitrogen utilization efficiency and reducing nitrogen loss. However, the deep placement of fertilizer increases the cost of mechanical fuel and labor, especially in the hilly and mountainous areas of southeast China and the comprehensive effects throughout the life cycle of crop production, including economic benefits, energy flow, and environmental and ecological ad-vantages, resulting from different application strategies for nitrogen fertilizer, are still largely unknown. In this work, a two-year field trial was conducted in Fujian Province, China, from 2021 to 2022. The main objectives of the study were to investigate the yield and GHG emissions resulting from the deep placement of slow-release fertilizer (DSK) and to assess the carbon footprint, energy use efficiency, and net economic and ecological benefits from a life-cycle perspective. The results showed that compared with deep placement of urea (DCK), slow-release fertilizer broadcasting (SK), and the traditional fertilization mode practiced by farmers (CK), the average annual yield of rice under DSK treatment significantly increased by 8.78%, 15.18%, and 23.54% respectively. Compared with CK, the contents of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and trans-Zeatin Riboside (t-ZR) under DSK were significantly increased and the dry matter translocation amount, Non-Structural Carbohydrates (NSC) translocation amount and Nitrogen translocation amount were significantly increased by 22.79%, 49.60% and 41.47% respectively. GHG emissions were indirectly reduced by the transport of above-ground substances to grains. The average cumulative CH4 emissions were significantly reduced by 25.34% in the DSK treatment, compared to the CK treatment, primarily as a result of decreased methanogenic gene abundance of mcra gene. Additionally, N2O emissions decreased significantly by 48.97%, compared to the CK, mainly due to a decrease in nirK gene abundance and an increase in nosZ gene abundance in denitrifying bacteria. Furthermore, the carbon footprint of the DSK treatment significantly decreased by 38.74% compared to the CK treatment, while net energy income and net ecological and economic benefits increased by 43.83% and 76.43%, respectively. Comprehensive analysis showed that deep placement of slow-release fertilizer is a sustainable nitrogen fertilizer management mode that helps to balance grain yield, environmental footprint, and economic benefits in southeast China.					zou, jingnan/HCI-9363-2022; Fang, Changxun/LXA-1172-2024; Xu, Hailong/IUP-2765-2023														0378-4290	1872-6852				FEB 1	2024	306								109224	10.1016/j.fcr.2023.109224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2023.109224		DEC 2023											WOS:001143224800001

All receptors were obtained in a modular fashion by sequential amidation of dimethyl squarate with corresponding amines, which allows for the simple introduction of a ferrocene unit and enables them to act as sensors. We found that ion pair receptors 1 and 2 recognized the tested anions more strongly in the presence of cations, whereas the homotopic anion receptor 3 was unable to bind sodium or potassium salts more strongly than tetrabutylammonium salts. This enhancement in anion binding was attributed to a cation complexation induced alteration in the nature of the phenyl ring substituents, directly linked to the squaramide anion binding site, changing from electron-donating to more withdrawing. Solid state X-ray measurements support this design principle of the receptors and reveal strong coordination of anions and cations to the corresponding binding domains. In both 1 center dot NaCl and 2 center dot KCl systems, organic moieties linked by the cations form 1-D polymeric structures in the crystal lattice. However, in the case of the 2 center dot NaCl complex the polymers' shape and orientation result in the formation of porous crystals with approximately 12% of the space unoccupied. Electrochemical measurements showed when the ion pair receptors (but not the anion receptor) were pretreated with sodium or potassium cations, the addition of anions resulted in greater changes in oxidation and reduction potentials compared to the addition of anions to the same receptors in the absence of cations. Overall, the study demonstrates that squaramides offer a convenient platform for constructing ion pair sensors in modular fashion by varying the cation binding site and reporters. This opens up the possibility of recognizing salts in real life scenarios where simultaneous binding of anions and cations is needed.

The combined effects of nitrification inhibitor and biochar incorporation on yield-scaled N2O emissions from an intensively managed vegetable field in southeastern China	BIOGEOSCIENCES												An experiment was conducted to study the influences of nitrification inhibitor (NI) and biochar incorporation on yield-scaled N2O using the static chamber method and gas chromatography in an intensively managed vegetable field with seven consecutive vegetable crops from 2012 to 2014 in southeastern China With an equal annual nitrogen (N) application rate (1217 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), six treatments under three biochar amendment rates namely, 0 tha(-1) (CO), 20 t ha(-1) (Cl) and 40 t ha(-1) (C2) with compound fertilizer (CF) or urea mixed with NI of nitrapyrin as chlorinated pyridine (CP) were studied in these field experiments. The results showed that, although there was no significant influence on soil organic carbon (SOC) content or total nitrogen (TN), nitrapyrin could result in a significant increase in soil pH during the experimental period. Nitrapyrin significantly decreased cumulative N2O emissions by 15.9-32.1 % while increasing vegetable yield by 9.8-41.9 %. Thus, it also decreased yield-scaled N2O emissions significantly. In addition to the differential responses of the soil pH, biochar amendment significantly increased SOC and TN. Compared with the treatments without biochar addition, the cumulative N2O emissions showed no significant difference in the CF or the CP group treatments but increased slightly (not significantly) by 7.9-18.3 % in the CP group treatments. Vegetable yield was enhanced by 7.1-49.5% in the CF group treatments compared with the treatments without biochar amendment, while there was no significant difference in the CP group treatments, and the yield-scaled N2O emissions were thus decreased significantly. Furthermore, treatments involving with nitrapyrin and biochar incorporation slightly increased yield-scaled N2O emissions by 9.4 %, on average, compared with CP-CO. Therefore, the application of nitrapyrin could serve as an appropriate practice for increasing vegetable yield and mitigating N2O emissions in intensively managed vegetable fields and should be further examined in various agroecosystems.					xiong, zhengqin/B-2808-2010; fan, chang/JKH-8311-2023	Li, Bo/0000-0003-3799-2018; Changhua, Fan/0000-0001-5804-7694													1726-4170	1726-4189					2015	12	6					2003	2017		10.5194/bg-12-2003-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-2003-2015													WOS:000352112900027
J	Li, YM; Shah, SHH; Wang, JY				Li, Yumei; Shah, Syed Hamid Hussain; Wang, Junye			Modelling of nitrification inhibitor and its effects on emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the UK	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Global food demand requires increased uses of fertilizers, leading to nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrate leaching due to overuse of fertilizers and poor timing between fertilizer application and plant growth. Using nitrification inhibitors (NIs) can reduce the N2O emissions but the effectiveness of NIs strongly depend on environmental conditions, and their benefits have been limited due to less than optimal nitrogen rates, timing, quantity, and placement of NIs. Process-based modelling can be helpful in improving the understanding of nitrogen fertilizer with NIs and their effects in different environmental conditions and agricultural practices. But few studies of modelling NIs with application to agricultural soils have been performed. In this paper, we developed a sophisticated biogeochemical reaction process of NIs applied to agricultural soils, which account for the factions of NIs with fertilizer by combining the application rate, soil moisture, and temperature within the DeNitrification DeComposition (DNDC) framework. This model was tested against the data from two agricultural farms in Preston Wynne and Newark in the UK. The results agreed well with the measured data and captured the measured soil moistures and N2O emissions. In Newark, the average Mean Absolute Error of all blocks is 8.78 and 5.45 for ammonium nitrate or urea respectively while in Preston Wynne, 3.48 and 3.14. The results also showed that the warming climate can greatly reduce the efficiency of nitrification inhibitors, which will further amplify the greenhouse gas impacts. The modified DNDC model of nitrification inhibitor modules can reliably simulate the inhibitory effect of NIs on N2O emissions and evaluate the efficiency of NIs. This enables end-users to optimize the amount of NIs used according to the time and climate conditions of fertilizer application for increasing crop yield and reducing N2O emissions and provides a useful tool for estimating the efficiency of NIs in agricultural management.

Nevertheless, the impact of biochar application on intensively cropped prairie eco-regions is not well documented, particularly when co-applied with chemical fertilizer. Our objective was to determine the effect of biochar on cumulative CO2-C, N2O-N and CH4-C emissions, water-extractable OM, and available N (AN; NH4-N + NO3-N) and P (AP; PO4-P) in the presence or absence of NP-fertilizer. Biochar was applied to two surface Chernozems (0-15 cm) of contrasting texture [i.e., sandy clay loam (Raymond) and clayey (Lethbridge)] at six rates (0, 0.15, 0.5, 3, 10 and 20 Mg ha(-1)) in combination with (+NP) or without (-NP) urea-N (150 kg N ha(-1)) and KH2PO4 (50 kg P ha(-1)). A total of 72 soil columns were incubated at 21.C for 86 d. Biochar addition increased soil total C up to 24.9 g kg(-1) and 28.7 g kg(-1) in Raymond and Lethbridge, respectively, but did not affect water-extractable OM. Cumulative N2O-N and CH4-C emissions were not influenced by biochar, regardless of whether or not NP-fertilizer was added (p > 0.05). Cumulative CO2-C emissions varied between soil textures and were increased or decreased non-linearly by biochar addition under -NP only. Available P increased within +NP soil with increasing biochar rates reaching 43.9 mg kg(-1) in Raymond and 79.5 mg kg(-1) in Lethbridge when biochar was applied at 20 Mg ha(-1). A similar but less pronounced response was observed for AN. Our results indicate that biochar-only application is not a practical management approach for improving soil fertility and nutrient cycling in surface Chernozems.

However, ensuring the appropriate supply of N to crops is challenging due to the various pathways through which N can be lost, such as ammonia (NH3) volatilization, nitrous oxide emissions, denitrification, nitrate (NO3-) leaching, and runoff. Additionally, N can become immobilized by soil minerals when ammonium (NH4+) gets trapped in the interlayers of clay minerals. Although synchronizing N availability with plant uptake could potentially reduce N loss, this approach is hindered by the fact that N loss from crop fields is typically influenced by a combination of management practices (which can be controlled) and weather dynamics, particularly precipitation, temperature fluctuations, and wind (which are beyond our control). In recent years, the use of urease and nitrification inhibitors has emerged as a strategy to temporarily delay the microbiological transformations of N-based fertilizers, thereby synchronizing N availability with plant uptake and mitigating N loss. Urease inhibitors slow down the hydrolysis of urea to NH4+ and reduce nitrogen loss through NH3 volatilization. Nitrification inhibitors temporarily inhibit soil bacteria (Nitrosomonas spp.) that convert NH4+ to nitrite (NO2-), thereby slowing down the first and rate-determining step of the nitrification process and reducing nitrogen loss as NO3- or through denitrification. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of urease and nitrification inhibitor technologies and their profound implications for plants and root nitrogen uptake. It underscores the critical need to develop design principles for inhibitors with enhanced efficiency, highlighting their potential to revolutionize agricultural practices. Furthermore, this review offers valuable insights into future directions for inhibitor usage and emphasizes the essential traits that superior inhibitors should possess, thereby paving the way for innovative advancements in optimizing nitrogen management and ensuring sustainable crop production.

J	Li, QC; Chen, SF; Liu, ZY; Liu, QY				Li, Qichao; Chen, Sifan; Liu, Zhenyu; Liu, Qingya			Combined effect of KCl and SO2 on the selective catalytic reduction of NO by NH3 over V2O5/TiO2 catalyst	APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL												In recent years, the alkali metal-induced deactivation of V2O5/TiO2 catalysts during the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by NH3 has received much attention. The presence of SO2 in flue gas may influence the alkali metal-induced deactivation because of its possible interactions with catalysts and alkali metals. This study aims to evaluate the combined effect of SO2 and alkali metals on the SCR activity of V2O5/TiO2 catalysts and identify the compound responsible for catalyst deactivation. KCl, the typical alkali substance in flue gases, was doped to in-house prepared V2O5/TiO2 catalysts by impregnation, and the KCl to V2O5/TiO2 (K/V) molar ratio was controlled at 0-0.3. The catalysts were subjected to the activity test for >120 h and characterized by BET, XPS, and FTIR. The results indicate that SO2 increases the deactivation of V2O5/TiO2 catalysts by KCl, and the increased extent depends on the amount of KCl deposited on the catalyst. At a K/V molar ratio of 0.1, K2S2O7 was formed and interacted with V2O5 to produce a eutectic; however, at a K/V ratio of 0.3, the eutectic was not observed. This eutectic significantly decreased NH3 adsorption, particularly those on Bronsted acid sites, and weakened the oxidation ability of the catalyst, thus significantly decreasing the SCR activity.

When the simple dimethyldipropylammonium cation is used as an organic structure-directing agent together with Na+ and K+, crystallization of pure UZM-35 is very sensitive not only to the types of Al and Si sources employed, but also to the SiO2/Al2O3 and K2O/(Na2O + K2O) ratios in the synthesis mixture. In the temperature range studied, fresh Cu-UZM-35 shows comparable deNOx performance to fresh Cu-SSZ-13, the best NH3-SCR catalyst known to date. When hydrothermally aged at 750 degrees C, although the latter catalyst outperforms the former one, the operating temperature window of Cu-UZM-35 is considerably wider than that of Cu-SSZ-13. Like Cu-beta, Cu-UZM-35 also produces a higher amount of N2O during SCR than Cu-SSZ-13 and Cu-ZSM-5. However, it shows a significantly lower NH3 oxidation activity than Cu-SSZ-13 and Cu-ZSM-5. The overall characterization results of this study demonstrate the highly stable nature of framework Al atoms in the large-pore zeolite UZM-35 and their strong interactions with Cu2+ ions. This may lead to a moderate alteration of exchanged Cu2+ ions to CuOx and CuAl2O4 phases at high temperatures, thus rendering Cu-UZM-35 hydrothermally stable during NH3-SCR. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Recent trends in the applications of thermally expanded graphite for energy storage and sensors - a review	NANOSCALE ADVANCES												Carbon nanomaterials such as carbon dots (0D), carbon nanotubes (1D), graphene (2D), and graphite (3D) have been exploited as electrode materials for various applications because of their high active surface area, thermal conductivity, high chemical stability and easy availability. In addition, due to the strong affinity between carbon nanomaterials and various catalysts, they can easily form metal carbides (examples: ionic, covalent, interstitial and intermediate transition metal carbides) and also help in the stable dispersion of catalysts on the surface of carbon nanomaterials. Thermally expanded graphite (TEG) is a vermicular-structured carbon material that can be prepared by heating expandable graphite up to 1150 degrees C using a muffle or tubular furnace. At high temperatures, the thermal expansion of graphite occurred by the intercalation of ions (examples: SO42-, NO3-, Li+, Na+, K+, etc.) and oxidizing agents (examples: ammonium persulfate, H2O2, potassium nitrate, potassium dichromate, potassium permanganate, etc.) which helped in the exfoliation process. Finally, the obtained TEG, an intumescent form of graphite, has been used in the preparation of composite materials with various conducting polymers (examples: epoxy, poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile), polyaniline, etc.) and metal chlorides (examples: FeCl3, CuCl2, and ZnCl2) for hydrogen storage, thermal energy storage, fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors, sensors, etc. The main features of TEG include a highly porous structure, very lightweight with an apparent density (0.002-0.02 g cm(-3)), high mechanical properties (10 MPa), thermal conductivity (25-470 W m(-1) K-1), high electrical conductivity (106-108 S cm(-1)) and low-cost. The porosity and expansion ratio of graphite layers could be customized by controlling the temperature and selection of intercalation ions according to the demand. Recently, TEG based composites prepared with metal oxides, chlorides and polymers have been demonstrated for their use in energy production, energy storage, and electrochemical (bio-) sensors (examples: urea, organic pollutants, Cd2+, Pb2+, etc.). In this review, we have highlighted and summarized the recent developments in TEG-based composites and their potential applications in energy storage, fuel cells and sensors with hand-picked examples.

J	Cho, K; Hoffmann, MR				Cho, Kangwoo; Hoffmann, Michael R.			Molecular hydrogen production from wastewater electrolysis cell with multi-junction BiOx/TiO2 anode and stainless steel cathode: Current and energy efficiency	APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL												Electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been recognized as a viable approach to generate a clean energy fuel. However, substantial technical breakthroughs are needed to reduce the costs for electricity and chemical reagents. In this study, we explore a specific wastewater electrolysis cell (WEC) as an alternative of decentralized H-2 production coupled with onsite water treatment. A prototypical WEC consists of a multi-junction semiconductor anode and a stainless steel cathode paired in single compartment cell. A distinct layer of BiOx/TiO2 on anode surface had relatively low crystallinity that was shown to be beneficial for higher oxide formation and O-2 evolution. The over-potential and Tafel slope of the BiOx/TiO2 anode were determined to be 0.32 V and 120 mV decade(-1). In a single compartment WEC with a NaCl electrolyte ([Cl-] <= 50 mM), the current density (j) ranged up to 500 A m(-2) at cell voltages less than 6V, while the current efficiency (CE) for free chlorine (FC) evolution showed maximum value near 0.3. The CE and energy efficiency (EE) for the HER were assessed using NaCI solutions (50 mM with or without 2.5 g L-1 urea) and real wastewater with variable compositions ([Cl-]: 6-33 mM, [chemical oxygen demand]: 60-790 mg L-1). The ohmic resistance of wastewater electrolyte rules out the usage of membrane separation, resulting in side reactions such as reduction of O-2 whose CE values monotonically decreased with an increasing j under the diffusion controlled regime. Chloride ions reduce the electron consumption during O-2 reduction, while elevated levels of FC significantly lower the CE for the HER. The combined presence of oxidizable organic compounds and Cl- enhance the CE for the HER as long as the concentration of organics is enough to quench FC to maintain a pseudo steady-state concentration. The highest CE (0.8) and EE (0.23) for HER were observed during electrolysis of real wastewater at j values exceeding 200 A m(-2). However, a dependency of value of EE on the applied cell voltage needs to be addressed further. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Unprecedented green chemistry approach: tungstophosphoric acid encapsulated in MOF 199 as competent acid catalyst for some significant organic transformations	JOURNAL OF POROUS MATERIALS												In the work, a series of new 12-tungstophosphoric acid (HPW) encapsulated MOF 199 catalysts were synthesized by simple and convenient one step method. The structural and textural properties of the synthesized catalysts were fully characterized by using different techniques such as FTIR, XRD, N(2)adsorption-desorption, TEM and SEM. The acidic properties were also studied by using nonaqueous potentiometric titration and FTIR spectra of chemisorbed pyridine techniques. The efficacy of the newly synthesized acid catalysts was tested in the production of 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-one through three-component coupling based Biginelli reaction and biodiesel production through stearic acid esterification reaction. The obtained results indicate that the MOF 199 preserves its structure without any noteworthy changes after the fruitful incorporation of HPW crystals within its cavities. Furthermore, an extraordinary improvement in both Lewis and Bronsted acid sites is observed as a result of the HPW encapsulation process. The catalytic activity results showed that the catalyst displayed excellent performance, where 98.3% of 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-one was obtained over 0.02 g of 50HPWMOF 199 after 2 h at 80 degrees C using benzaldehyde: ethyl acetoacetate: urea molar ratios of 1:1:1.5. Additionally, 94.1% conversion of stearic acid was observed after 3 h over 0.05 g of 50HPWMOF 199 at similar to 80 degrees C using stearic acid: ethanol molar ratio of 1:8. Moreover, the catalysts also demonstrated excellent reusability in the investigated organic reactions which can be used many consecutive eras without meaningful loss of their catalytic performance. The achieved high catalytic performance of the synthesized catalysts in the Biginelli and esterification reactions are attributed to uniform HPW distribution inside MOF 199 cavities as well as the Lewis acidity property of MOF 199. The results also demonstrated that the incorporation of HPW crystals within MOF 199 cavities through the encapsulation process is more efficient than the impregnation method.

A green, productive, and environmentally method was developed for the valuable study and the effective preparation of the green-synthesis of iron nanoparticles using aqueous extracts from the leaf of Ziziphora clinopodioides as a result of reducing and stabilizing factor. The simplicity of the synthesis procedures and easy work up are the benefits of the present study. The structural and morphological characterization of green-synthesized FeNPs was performed by Uv-Vis. and FT-IR spectroscopy, XRD, SEM, and EDX techniques. The SEM images have exhibited an equal and uniform spherical morphology in size of 30.04. We also investigated the anti-hemolytic anemia property of FeNPs in an animal model of hemolytic anemia. In vivo assay, induction of hemolytic anemia was done by phenylhydrazine in mice. FeNPs significantly reduced the weight and volume of liver and spleen and the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the body weight, the anti-inflammatory cytokines concentration, and the total platelet, WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil, monocyte, and basophil counts, and RBC parameters as compared to the untreated mice. About the biochemical parameters, FeNPs significantly increased GPx, CAT, and SOD in serum, liver, and spleen, and also HDL, total protein, and albumin in serum, and decreased GR in serum, liver, and spleen, and also erythropoietin, ferritin, ferrous, creatinine, urea, LDL, triglyceride, cholesterol, GGT, ALT, AST, and ALP in serum as compared to the anemic mice. DPPH test revealed similar antioxidant potentials for FeNPs and Butylated hydroxytoluene. FeNPs had low cell viability dose-dependently against HUVEC cell line. It appears that FeNPs can be administrated as a hematoprotective and anti-hemolytic anemia drug or supplement for the treatment of hemolytic anemia in the clinical trial.

J	Villa, FB; Chiaregato, CG; Faez, R				Villa, Felipe Bernegossi; Chiaregato, Camila Gruber; Faez, Roselena			Novel core-shell microcapsules incorporating macro/micronutrients in PVA/starch matrix	MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS												Enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEFs) have been widely used due to their ability to meet crop nutritional needs and reduce the main problem of leaching. In this work, we compared the effects of spray -dryer microspheres and microcapsules on nutrient encapsulation and identified the spheres and core -shell structures by fluorescence microscopy using Rhodamine B (RB) as the fluorescent material. The microsphere matrix was based on starch, and the microcapsules consisted of starch as the core and poly (vinyl alcohol) as the shell. The fluorescent images confirmed that the RB was incorporated into the starch, as the overlap of fluorescence and brightfield images covered the entire area for microspheres and only the core for microcapsules. Microspheres exhibited an irregular and non -spherical morphology, whereas microcapsules presented a spherical shape with a smooth and homogeneous surface featuring small aggregated particles. The microparticle structures remained unchanged even after incorporating KNO3, Fe, Cu, and Mn. Thermal analysis indicated lower initial mass loss temperatures for the microcapsules, suggesting polymer interactions during drying and formation. FTIR further supported this, which revealed structural changes and partial oxidation during drying, contributing to reduced thermodegradation. Notably, micronutrient-based microcapsules demonstrated a significantly lower burst release than macro/micronutrient-based microcapsules and micronutrient-based microspheres. Fe and Cu were released most rapidly from microspheres in the first hour, reaching 84.2% and 79.4%, respectively. In contrast, macro/ micronutrient-based microcapsules released 66.1% and 67.7%, while micronutrient-based microcapsules released 53.1% and 61.5%. As for Mn, macro/micronutrient-based microcapsules exhibited the highest initial release at 72.4%, followed by micronutrient-based microcapsules at 62.2%, with microspheres releasing at 55.8%. Additionally, the Peppas-Sahlin model provided the best fit, indicating diffusional and polymer relaxation contributions. The morphology, release, and kinetics behaviors confirmed that the core -shell prolonged the nutrient release by reducing the initial burst release, thanks to the diffusion barrier provided by the PVA layer.

Impurities in Nitrile Solvents Commonly Used for Electrochemistry, and their Effects on Voltammetric Data	CHEMELECTROCHEM												Voltammetry experiments were performed on 1,4-benzoquinone and 1,4-phenylenediamine in acetonitrile, propionitrile (from five commercial suppliers: Acros Organics, Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, Fluka, and Merck), and butyronitrile, to which different electrochemical responses were collected across the three nitrile solvents and within the five commercial brands of propionitrile, owing to the reduced (1,4-benzoquinone) or oxidized (1,4-phenylenediamine) compounds reacting with impurities in the solvents. Of the three solvents, propionitrile suffered from the most impurities, which adversely affected the electrochemical results. Distillation of the propionitrile over phosphorus pentoxide or passing it through a flash column containing silica gel was partially effective in removing some of the impurities and resulted in the recovery of the familiar oxidation be-havior of 1,4-phenylenediamine. The reduction behavior of 1,4-benzoquinone could be improved if propionitrile was purified by passing it through a column of basic activated alumina, thus a combination of distillation and flash chromatography is necessary to adequately purify propionitrile for reductive and oxidative voltammetry experiments. Purge and trap-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses positively identified 2-methyl-2-pentenal among the impurities, but it was discovered to only have a mild effect on the voltammetric behavior of the quinone and not exert any influence on the electrochemical response of the phenylenediamine. The results of this study lead to the possibility of using the voltammetry of quinones and phenylenediamines as a sensitive method for determining the purity of organic solvents.

A total of 0, 50, and 200 mg/kg of dihydroquercetin were intragastrically administered once a day for 21 days. After the pretreatment with dihydroquercetin, each group was subjected to a lipopolysaccharide challenge (except for the control group). After lipopolysaccharide injection, food intake, body weight, metabolic indexes of blood and liver nutrients, blood inflammatory factors, and liver oxidative stress indexes were measured at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively. Indirect calorimetry analysis was performed by respiratory gas analysis for 48 h to calculate the energy substrate metabolism of carbohydrate, fat, and protein. Urinary nitrogen excretion was measured to evaluate the urinary protein metabolism to calculate the substrate utilization. The results showed that dihydroquercetin pretreatment can significantly increase the weight gain and average food intake and decrease the mortality rate in lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation mice. Furthermore, dihydroquercetin pretreatment can alleviate the negative effects of lipopolysaccharides by increasing levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase and by decreasing the malondialdehyde and serum inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1 beta, nuclear factor kappa B, and interleukin-6). Dihydroquercetin pretreatment also can relieve nutrient metabolic disorder by increasing blood glucose, serum total protein, and liver glycogen levels and reducing serum and liver triglycerides, serum cholesterol, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and serum urea nitrogen levels. Meanwhile, it increases the relative utilization of carbohydrate, reducing relative utilization of protein and lipid, alleviating the change in energy metabolism pattern from glucose-predominant to lipid-predominant caused by lipopolysaccharide stimulation. In addition, the degree of metabolic pattern transformation depends on the dose of dihydroquercetin supplement. Finally, according to principal component analysis, we found that the inflammation was strongest in the mice at 24 h and was subsequently relieved in the LPS-stimulated group, whereas in the dihydroquercetin-pretreated group, the inflammation was initially relieved. To summarize, dihydroquercetin pretreatment can improve energy metabolism disorder and attenuate the negative effects of lipopolysaccharide challenge in mice from the initial stage of inflammation.

J	Driedzic, WR				Driedzic, William R.			Rainbow smelt: the unusual case of cryoprotection by sustained glycerol production in an aquatic animal	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												Rainbow smelt flourish at -1.8 A degrees C, the freezing point of sea water. An antifreeze protein contributes to freeze point depression but, more importantly, cryoprotection is due to an elevation in osmotic pressure, by the accumulation of glycerol. The lower the water temperature, the higher the plasma glycerol with levels recorded as high as 400 mmol l(-1). Glycerol freely diffuses out in direct relation to the glycerol concentration and fish may lose as much as 15 % of their glycerol reserve per day. Glycerol levels decrease from a maximum in February/March while water temperature is still sub-zero. The decrease in glycerol may respond to a photoperiod signal as opposed to initiation which is triggered by low temperature. The initial increase in glycerol level is supported by liver glycogen but high sustained glycerol level is dependent upon dietary carbohydrate and protein. The metabolic pathways leading to glycerol involve flux from glycogen/glucose to the level of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) via the initial part of glycolysis and from amino acids via a truncated gluconeogenesis again to the level of DHAP. DHAP in turn is converted to glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) and then directly to glycerol. The key to directing DHAP to G3P is a highly active glycerol 3-P dehydrogenase. G3P is converted directly to glycerol via G3P phosphatase, the rate-limiting step in the process. The transition to glycerol production is associated with increased activities of enzymes at key loci in the top part of glycogenolysis/glycolysis. Curtailment of the final section of glycolysis may reside at the level of pyruvate oxidation with an inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) driven by increased levels of PDH kinase.

In a 2 x 2-factorial experiment, the effects of supplementing a phenolic grapeseed extract were compared in 11 East Friesian dairy sheep and 9 Saanen goats. The concentrate, supplemented with 7.4 g/100 g DM grapeseed extract, had contents of 3.5 g additional phenols/100 g DM and was compared with a low phenolic control concentrate. Performance, total phenols in blood, milk, urine and feces, antioxidant capacity of the blood, and saliva properties were examined. The experiment lasted for 11 wk from parturition to late lactation, with an initial adaptation phase of 1 wk. Milk yield was measured daily after weaning at about 7 wk after parturition. Blood, milk, saliva, feces, and urine were sampled 4, 3, 2, 2, and 2 times per animal, respectively. The phenolic diet increased phenol concentrations in blood (+10% and 17% in weeks 5 and 11, respectively) and in milk (+32% in week 5) in some of the sampling weeks. There were no clear species differences in phenol concentrations in blood plasma, milk, urine, and feces. However, at the end of the experiment, the supplemented goats had higher (P < 0.05) urinary phenol concentrations than the non-supplemented goats. A weak relationship (P < 0.05) was found between phenol intake and phenol excretion with milk for sheep but not goats. The phenolic diet did not influence blood antioxidant capacity and tannin-binding capacity of the saliva. The saliva of the goats had a higher tannin-binding capacity than sheep saliva. The effects of the extract on milk yield were inconsistent between sheep and goats. In general, goats had higher feed and nutrient intakes, were heavier, and yielded more milk. Additionally, milk protein and lactose contents were lower and milk urea content was higher in goats than sheep. In conclusion, supplementing grapeseed extract to sheep and goats elevated phenol concentrations in milk and blood to a certain extent, but most of the phenols were lost via urine. The study gave another indication that goats seem to have developed coping mechanisms like a higher salivary tannin-binding capacity, mechanisms which are less pronounced in sheep.

Guy			Greenhouse gas (N2O and CH4) fluxes under nitrogen-fertilised dryland wheat and barley on subtropical Vertosols: risk, rainfall and alternatives	SOIL RESEARCH												The northern Australian grains industry relies on nitrogen (N) fertiliser to optimise yield and protein, but N fertiliser can increase soil fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). We measured soil N2O and CH4 fluxes associated with wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) using automated (Expts 1, 3) and manual chambers (Expts 2, 4, 5). Experiments were conducted on subtropical Vertosol soils fertilised with N rates of 0-160 kg N ha(-1). In Expt 1 (2010), intense rainfall for a month before and after sowing elevated N2O emissions from N-fertilised (80 kg N ha(-1)) wheat, with 417 g N2O-N ha(-1) emitted compared with 80 g N2O-N ha(-1) for non-fertilised wheat. Once crop N uptake reduced soil mineral N, there was no further treatment difference in N2O. Expt 2 (2010) showed similar results, however, the reduced sampling frequency using manual chambers gave a lower cumulative N2O. By contrast, very low rainfall before and for several months after sowing Expt 3 (2011) resulted in no difference in N2O emissions between N-fertilised and non-fertilised barley. N2O emission factors were 0.42, 0.20 and -0.02 for Expts 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In Expts 4 and 5 (2011), N2O emissions increased with increasing rate of N fertiliser. Emissions were reduced by 45% when the N fertiliser was applied in a 50 : 50 split between sowing and mid-tillering, or by 70% when urea was applied with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole-phosphate. Methane fluxes were typically small and mostly negative in all experiments, especially in dry soils. Cumulative CH4 uptake ranged from 242 to 435 g CH4-C ha(-1) year(-1), with no effect of N fertiliser treatment. Considered in terms of CO2 equivalents, soil CH4 uptake offset 8-56% of soil N2O emissions, with larger offsets occurring in non-N-fertilised soils. The first few months from N fertiliser application to the period of rapid crop N uptake pose the main risk for N2O losses from rainfed cereal cropping on subtropical Vertosols, but the realisation of this risk is dependent on rainfall. Strategies that reduce the soil mineral N pool during this time can reduce the risk of N2O loss.

A20 isolated from a hot spring in Costa Rica was sequenced. This circular genome of the strain is 2,688,317 bp in size and 34.8% in G+C content, and contains 2591 open reading frames (ORFs). Strain A20 shares 95.6% identity at the 16S rRNA gene sequence level and <30% DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) values with the most closely related known Sulfolobus species (i.e., Sulfolobus islandicus and Sulfolobus solfataricus), suggesting that it represents a novel Sulfolobus species. Comparison of the genome of strain A20 with those of the type strains of S. solfataricus, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, S. islandicus, and Sulfolobus tokodaii, which were isolated from geographically separated areas, identified 1801 genes conserved among all Sulfolobus species analyzed (core genes). Comparative genome analyses show that central carbon metabolism in Sulfolobus is highly conserved, and enzymes involved in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the CO2 fixation pathways are predominantly encoded by the core genes. All Sulfolobus species encode genes required for the conversion of ammonium into glutamate/glutamine. Some Sulfolobus strains have gained the ability to utilize additional nitrogen source such as nitrate (i.e., S. islandicus strain REY15A, LAL14/1, M14.25, and M16.27) or urea (i.e., S. islandicus HEV10/4, S. tokodair strain7, and S. rnetallicus DSM 6482). The strategies for sulfur metabolism are most diverse and least understood. S. tokodaii encodes sulfur oxygenase/reductase (SOR), whereas both S. islandicus and S. solfataricus contain genes for sulfur reductase (SRE). However, neither SOR nor SRE genes exist in the genome of strain A20, raising the possibility that an unknown pathway for the utilization of elemental sulfur may be present in the strain. The ability of Sulfolobus to utilize nitrate or sulfur is encoded by a gene cluster flanked by IS elements or their remnants. These clusters appear to have become fixed at a specific genomic site in some strains and lost in other strains during the course of evolution. The versatility in nitrogen and sulfur metabolism may represent adaptation of Sulfolobus to thriving in different habitats.

J	Mouren, A; Averous, L				Mouren, Agathe; Averous, Luc			Sustainable cycloaliphatic polyurethanes: from synthesis to applications	CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS												Polyurethanes (PUs) are a versatile and major polymer family, mainly produced via polyaddition between polyols and polyisocyanates. A large variety of fossil-based building blocks is commonly used to develop a wide range of macromolecular architectures with specific properties. Due to environmental concerns, legislation, rarefaction of some petrol fractions and price fluctuation, sustainable feedstocks are attracting significant attention, e.g., plastic waste and biobased resources from biomass. Consequently, various sustainable building blocks are available to develop new renewable macromolecular architectures such as aromatics, linear aliphatics and cycloaliphatics. Meanwhile, the relationship between the chemical structures of these building blocks and properties of the final PUs can be determined. For instance, aromatic building blocks are remarkable to endow materials with rigidity, hydrophobicity, fire resistance, chemical and thermal stability, whereas acyclic aliphatics endow them with oxidation and UV light resistance, flexibility and transparency. Cycloaliphatics are very interesting as they combine most of the advantages of linear aliphatic and aromatic compounds. This original and unique review presents a comprehensive overview of the synthesis of sustainable cycloaliphatic PUs using various renewable products such as biobased terpenes, carbohydrates, fatty acids and cholesterol and/or plastic waste. Herein, we summarize the chemical modification of the main sustainable cycloaliphatic feedstocks, synthesis of PUs using these building blocks and their corresponding properties and subsequently present their major applications in hot-topic fields, including building, transportation, packaging and biomedicine.

EETs are rapidly metabolised in vivo by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Increasing the half life of EETs by inhibiting the sEH enzyme is a novel strategy for neuroprotection. In the present study, sEH inhibitors APAU was screened in silica and further evaluated for their antiparkinson activity against rotenone (ROT) induced neurodegeneration in N27 dopaminergic cell line and Drosophila melanogaster model of Parkinson disease (PD). In the in vitro study cell viability (MTT and LDH release assay), oxidative stress parameters (total intracellular ROS, hydroperoxides, protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidise, glutathione reductase, glutathione, total antioxidant status, mitochondrial complex-1 activity and mitochondrial membrane potential), inflammatory markers (IL-6, COX-1 and COX-2), and apoptotic markers (JNK, phospho-JNK, c-jun, phospho-c-jun, pro and active caspase-3) were assessed to study the neuroprotective effects. In vivo activity of APAU was assessed in Drosophila melanogaster by measuring survival rate, negative geotaxis, oxidative stress parameters (total intracellular ROS, hydroperoxides, glutathione levels) were measured. Dopamine and its metabolites were estimated by LC-MS/MS analysis. In the in silica study the molecule, APAU showed good binding interaction at the active site of sEH (PDB: 1VJ5). In the in vitro study, APAU significantly attenuated ROT induced changes in oxidative, pro-inflammatory and apoptotic parameters. In the in vivo study, APAU significantly attenuates ROT induced changes in survival rate, negative geotaxis, oxidative stress, dopamine and its metabolites levels (p < 0.05). Our study, therefore, concludes that the molecule APAU, has significant neuroprotection benefits against rotenone induced Parkinsonism.

To effectively tackle climate change, finding ways to reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) 2 O) emissions from green manuring systems is vital. Herein, field and 15 N labeled microcosm experiments were arranged to investigate the effect and mechanisms of green manuring and zeolite application on N2O 2 O emission. Both experiments comprised four treatments: conventional chemical N (N100), 70% chemical N (N70), N70 with green manure (N70 + CV), and N70 + CV combined with zeolite (N70 + CV + Z). Compared with N100, both N70 + CV and N70 + CV + Z maintained maize yield, cumulative N2O 2 O emissions decreased by 37.7 % and 34.9 % in N70 + CV + Z in 2022-yr and 2023-yr, and by 12.8% in N70 + CV in 2022-yr. Moreover, the reduction of N2O 2 O emission primarily occurred after incorporating green manure. The N100 and N70 + CV demonstrated a similar transformed proportion of chemical N to N2O 2 O (i.e., 4.9% and 4.7%) while reducing it to 2.7% in N70 + CV + Z. Additionally, a mere 0.7 % of green manure N was transformed to N2O 2 O in both N70 + CV and N70 + CV + Z treatments. Compared with N100, both N70 + CV and N70 + CV + Z decreased the relative abundances of ammonia oxidation microbes, increased denitrifier and the ratios of (nirK + nirS)/nosZ and norBC/nosZ. . Furthermore, compared with N70 + CV, N70 + CV + Z decreased the relative abundances of N2O-producer 2 O-producer and the ratios of (nirK + nirS)/nosZ and norBC/nosZ in denitrification. These findings revealed that the reduction of N2O 2 O emissions resulting from green manure replaced chemical N was mainly due to weakened nitrification, while zeolite reduced N2O 2 O emissions attributed to enhanced conversion of N2O 2 O to N2. 2 . Moreover, certain key N-cycling functional bacteria, such as Phycisphaerae, Rubrobacteria, and Thermoflexia, were positively correlated with N2O 2 O emission. In contrast, Dehalococcoidia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria were negatively correlated with N2O 2 O emission. This investigation uncovered the underlying mechanisms for effectively reducing N2O 2 O emissions through green manuring combined with zeolite.

High-yield reactivation of anionic tobacco peroxidase overexpressed in Escherichia coli	PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION												Anionic tobacco peroxidase (TOP) is extremely active in chemiluminescence reaction of luminol oxidation without addition of enhancers and more stable than horseradish peroxidase under antibody conjugation conditions. In addition, recombinant TOP (rTOP) produced in Escherichia coli is known to be a perfect direct electron transfer catalyst on electrodes of various origin. These features make the task of development of a high-yield reactivation protocol for rTOP practically important. Previous attempts to reactivate the enzyme from E. coli inclusion bodies were successful, but the reported reactivation yield was only 14%. In this work, we thoroughly screened the refolding conditions for dilution protocol and compared it with gel-filtration chromatography. The impressive reactivation yield in the dilution protocol (85%) was achieved for 8 mu g/mL solubilized rTOP protein and the refolding medium containing 0.3 mM oxidized glutathione, 0.05 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM CaCl2, 5% glycerol in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.6, with 1 mu M hemin added at the 24th hour of incubation. A practically important discovery was a 30-40% increase in the reactivation yield upon delayed addition of hemin. The reactivation yield achieved is one of the highest reported in the literature on protein refolding by dilution. The final yield of purified active non-glycosylated rTOP was ca. 60 mg per L of E. coli culture, close to the yield reported before for tomato and tobacco plants overexpressing glycosylated TOP (60 mg/kg biomass) and much higher than for the previously reported refolding protocol (2.6 mg per L of E. coli culture).

J	Jin, WY; Zhang, YB; Zhao, ZJ; Gao, MY				Jin, Wenyi; Zhang, Yubiao; Zhao, Zhijie; Gao, Mingyong			Developing targeted therapies for neuroblastoma by dissecting the effects of metabolic reprogramming on tumor microenvironments and progression	THERANOSTICS												Rationale: Synergic reprogramming of metabolic dominates neuroblastoma (NB) progression. It is of great clinical implications to develop an individualized risk prognostication approach with stratification -guided therapeutic options for NB based on elucidating molecular mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming. Methods: With a machine learning -based multi -step program, the synergic mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming -driven malignant progression of NB were elucidated at single -cell and metabolite flux dimensions. Subsequently, a promising metabolic reprogramming -associated prognostic signature (MPS) and individualized therapeutic approaches based on MPS -stratification were developed and further validated independently using pre -clinical models. Results: MPS -identified MPS -I NB showed significantly higher activity of metabolic reprogramming than MPS -II counterparts. MPS demonstrated improved accuracy compared to current clinical characteristics [AUC: 0.915 vs. 0.657 ( MYCN ), 0.713 (INSS-stage), and 0.808 (INRG-stratification)] in predicting prognosis. AZD7762 and etoposide were identified as potent therapeutics against MPS -I and II NB, respectively. Subsequent biological tests revealed AZD7762 substantially inhibited growth, migration, and invasion of MPS -I NB cells, more effectively than that of MPS -II cells. Conversely, etoposide had better therapeutic effects on MPS -II NB cells. More encouragingly, AZD7762 and etoposide significantly inhibited in -vivo subcutaneous tumorigenesis, proliferation, and pulmonary metastasis in MPS -I and MPS -II samples, respectively; thereby prolonging survival of tumor -bearing mice. Mechanistically, AZD7762 and etoposide-induced apoptosis of the MPS -I and MPS -II cells, respectively, through mitochondria -dependent pathways; and MPS -I NB resisted etoposide-induced apoptosis by addiction of glutamate metabolism and acetyl coenzyme A. MPS -I NB progression was fueled by multiple metabolic reprogramming -driven factors including multidrug resistance, immunosuppressive and tumor -promoting inflammatory microenvironments. Immunologically, MPS -I NB suppressed immune cells via MIF and THBS signaling pathways. Metabolically, the malignant proliferation of MPS -I NB cells was remarkably supported by reprogrammed glutamate metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, urea cycle, etc. Furthermore, MPS -I NB cells manifested a distinct tumor -promoting developmental lineage and self -communication patterns, as evidenced by enhanced oncogenic signaling pathways activated with development and self -communications. Conclusions: This study provides deep insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming -mediated malignant progression of NB. It also sheds light on developing targeted medications guided by the novel precise risk prognostication approaches, which could contribute to a significantly improved therapeutic strategy for NB.					zhang, yubiao/HGB-5081-2022; JIN, Wenyi/AAS-1593-2020; zhao, zhijie/IQX-1475-2023	Jin, Wenyi/0000-0002-3226-1606; Zhao, Zhijie/0000-0001-5587-8855													1838-7640						2024	14	9					3439	3469		10.7150/thno.93962	http://dx.doi.org/10.7150/thno.93962								38948053					WOS:001245993900004

Electrochemical assessement of the therapeutic agent of dietary nitrite in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats based on Ni-Cu/nanotitania sensor	MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL												Nitrite compounds are very important in many industrials that may cause some significant problems, but in more or less cases it has useful effect. Therefore, the present study was carried out to shed the light on the effect of nitrite on streptozotocin (STZ) inducing diabetic rats. In this study, thirty-two male Wister rats were distributed into four groups (n= 8 per group): Group (1) control group; Group (2) normal rats received NaNO2 30 mg/kg body weight; Group (3) diabetic group rats received 45 mg/kg STZ intraperitoneal (IP); Group (4) diabetic rats treated daily with NaNO2 for three months. Serum from each group was collected from rat's blood samples to measure aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Urea, and Creatinine. A self-assembled nanostructure titania (TiO2) based surface similar to honey cells was synthesized by a simple, fast, low-cost procedure using the 2D electrochemical cell at sequence potential from 5 V to 30 V for 2 h followed by annealed method at 350 degrees C and 750 degrees C for 3 h. A linear sweep voltammetry electrochemical method was used to deposit the Ni-Cu nanoparticles on titania surface providing a highly sensing platform of Ni-Cu/nanotitania array. Both the degree of sensing (46 mu A mM(-1)) for the electrode were calculated through low detection range from 0.00 to 0.35 mM of glucose via cyclic voltammetry and amperometery techniques. By increasing the glucose concentration through the detection range from 0.4 to 2.5 mM the sensitivity increased to 248 mu A mM(-1). This significant change indicates that the sensitivity of the electrode is suitable for diabetes measurements, We reported for the first electrochemical sensor fabricated from Ni-Cu/nanotitania to detect glucose level in real urine samples and we used this level as a marker for the effect of nitrite present in the drinking water. The results showed that the presence of low concentration of sodium nitrite can enhance the liver and kidney functions in diabetic rats and also lead to the decrease of the glucose concentration in urine. Additionally, Ni-Cu/nanotitania sensor also has stability, profitable good reproducibility and applicability that guarantee its value in the medical applications as in the environmental applications that has been proven previously.

A.; Ashour, Ibrahim			Fabrication of N-doping activated carbons from fish waste and sawdust for Acid Yellow 36 dye removal from an aquatic environment	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Acid Yellow 36 (AY36) dye is a synthetic azo dye that is excessively used in various industries, causing hazardous environmental effects. The main target of this study is the preparation of self-N-doped porous activated carbon (NDAC) and the investigation in eliminating the AY36 dye from the water solution. The NDAC was prepared by mixing fish waste (60% protein content) which was considered a self-nitrogen dopant. A combination of Fish waste, sawdust, zinc chloride and urea with a mass ratio (5:5:5:1) was submitted to hydrothermal process at 180 degrees C for 5 h followed by pyrolysis for 1 h under N-2 stream at 600, 700, and 800 degrees C. Fabricated NDAC was qualified as an adsorbent for recovering AY36 dye from water using batch trials. The fabricated NDAC samples were characterized by FTIR, TGA, DTA, BET, BJH, MP, t-plot, SEM, EDX, and XRD methods. The results showed the successful formation of NDAC with nitrogen mass percentage content (4.21, 8.13 and 9.85%). The NDAC prepared at 800 degrees C had the largest nitrogen content (9.85%) and was labeled as NDAC800. This later had 727.34 m(2)/g, 167.11 cm(3)/g, and 1.97 nm for specific surface area, the monolayer volume and the mean pores diameter respectively. By being the more efficient adsorbent, NDAC800 was chosen to test AY36 dye removal. Therefore, it is selected to investigate the removal of AY36 dye from aqueous solution by varying important parameters such as solution pH, initial dye concentration, adsorbent dosage and contact time. The removal of AY36 dye by NDAC800 was pH-dependent, with the optimum pH value 1.5 giving 85.86% removal efficiency and 232.56 mg/g maximum adsorption capacity (Q(m)). The kinetic data exhibited the best fit model with the pseudo-second-order (PSOM), while the equilibrium data fit well with the Langmuir (LIM) and Temkin (TIM). The mechanism of AY36 dye adsorption may be ascribed to the electrostatic contact between the dye and the available charged sites on NDAC800 surface. The prepared NDAC800 may be considered as an efficient, available, and eco-friendly adsorbent for AY36 dye adsorption from simulated water.

ECOSPHERE												Replacement of forest by agricultural systems is a major factor accelerating the emissions of greenhouse gases; however, related field studies in the tropics are very scarce. To evaluate the impact of forest transition to plantations on soil methane (CH4) and respiration (CO2) fluxes, we conducted measurements in an undisturbed forest, a disturbed forest, young and old rubber plantations, and an oil palm plantation on mineral soil in Jambi, Sumatra, Indonesia. Methane fluxes and their controlling variables were monitored monthly over fourteen months; soil respiration was measured less frequently. All of the plantations were managed by smallholders and had never been fertilized. To assess the effect of common management practices in oil palm plantations, we added urea at a rate of 33.3 kg N/ha and thereafter monitored intensively soil CH4 fluxes. The soil acted as a sink for CH4 (kg CH4-C center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)) in the undisturbed forest (-1.4 +/- 1.0) and young rubber plantation (-1.7 +/- 0.7). This was not the case in the other land-use systems which had fluxes similar to fluxes in the undisturbed forest, with 0.4 +/- 0.9, -0.2 +/- 0.3, and 0.2 +/- 0.7 kg center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1) in the disturbed forest, old rubber plantation, and oil palm plantation, respectively. In the oil palm plantation, there was no inhibitory effect of nitrogenous fertilizer on methanotrophy. Annual soil respiration (Mg CO2-C center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)) was higher in the oil palm plantation (17.1 +/- 1.9) than in the undisturbed forest (13.9 +/- 1.2) while other land-use systems respired at a similar level to the undisturbed forest (13.1 +/- 1.4, 15.9 +/- 1.7, and 14.1 +/- 1.0 in the disturbed forest, young, and old rubber plantations, respectively). Substrate (litterfall and soil) availability and quality exerted a strong control over annual fluxes of both gases along the land-use gradient. Temporal variation in CH4 was extremely high and in respiration fluxes was moderate, but was not specifically linked to seasonal variation. Further comprehensive and long-term research is critically needed to determine more thoroughly the direction and magnitude of changes in soil trace gas emissions as affected by forest-to-plantation conversion in the tropics.

Crystalline Peroxosolvates: Nature of the Coformer, Hydrogen-Bonded Networks and Clusters, Intermolecular Interactions	MOLECULES												Despite the technological importance of urea perhydrate (percarbamide) and sodium percarbonate, and the growing technological attention to solid forms of peroxide, fewer than 45 peroxosolvates were known by 2000. However, recent advances in X-ray diffractometers more than tripled the number of structurally characterized peroxosolvates over the last 20 years, and even more so, allowed energetic interpretation and gleaning deeper insight into peroxosolvate stability. To date, 134 crystalline peroxosolvates have been structurally resolved providing sufficient insight to justify a first review article on the subject. In the first chapter of the review, a comprehensive analysis of the structural databases is carried out revealing the nature of the co-former in crystalline peroxosolvates. In the majority of cases, the coformers can be classified into three groups: (1) salts of inorganic and carboxylic acids; (2) amino acids, peptides, and related zwitterions; and (3) molecular compounds with a lone electron pair on nitrogen and/or oxygen atoms. The second chapter of the review is devoted to H-bonding in peroxosolvates. The database search and energy statistics revealed the importance of intermolecular hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) which play a structure-directing role in the considered crystals. H2O2 always forms two H-bonds as a proton donor, the energy of which is higher than the energy of analogous H-bonds existing in isostructural crystalline hydrates. This phenomenon is due to the higher acidity of H2O2 compared to water and the conformational mobility of H2O2. The dihedral angle H-O-O-H varies from 20 to 180 degrees in crystalline peroxosolvates. As a result, infinite H-bonded 1D chain clusters are formed, consisting of H2O2 molecules, H2O2 and water molecules, and H2O2 and halogen anions. H2O2 can form up to four H-bonds as a proton acceptor. The third chapter of the review is devoted to energetic computations and in particular density functional theory with periodic boundary conditions. The approaches are considered in detail, allowing one to obtain the H-bond energies in crystals. DFT computations provide deeper insight into the stability of peroxosolvates and explain why percarbamide and sodium percarbonate are stable to H2O2/H2O isomorphic transformations. The review ends with a description of the main modern trends in the synthesis of crystalline peroxosolvates, in particular, the production of peroxosolvates of high-energy compounds and mixed pharmaceutical forms with antiseptic and analgesic effects.

Method: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of NDQG for DKD from Chinese and English databases up to 31 August 2022 were included. The quality of the literature was assessed using the risk of bias tool of the Cochrane Handbook. At a 95% confidence interval (CI), relative risk (RR) and Cohen's d were used for the categorical and continuous variables, respectively, and Stata 16.0 software was used for statistical analysis. A funnel plot and Egger's tests were used to assess publication bias. Result: A total of 4,006 patients were included in 52 RCTs, including 1,987 cases in the control group and 2,019 cases in the treatment group. Compared with conventional treatment (CT), combined NDQG therapy is more effective in improving clinical efficiency [RR = 1.23, 95% confidence interval (1.17, 1.29), p < 0.001, I-2 = 53.17%], kidney function (urinary albumin excretion rate [SMD = -0.90, 95% CI (-1.14, -0.66), p < 0.001, I-2 = 78.19%], 24hUTP levels [SMD = -0.81, 95% CI (-1.08, -0.55), p < 0.001, I-2 = 87.08%], blood urea nitrogen [SMD = -0.54, 95% CI (-0.69, -0.39), p < 0.01, I-2 = 77.01%], SCr [SMD = -0.68, 95% CI (-0.90, -0.45), p < 0.001, I-2 = 89.97%], CCr [SMD = 0.76, 95% CI (0.10,1.42), p = 0.02, I-2 = 95.97%], and Cys-C [SMD = -1.32, 95% CI (-2.25, -0.40), p = 0.01, I-2 = 93.44%]), the level of glucose metabolism (fasting blood glucose [SMD = -0.18, 95% CI (-0.38, 0.03), p = 0.10, I-2 = 71.18%] and HbA1c [SMD = -0.42, 95% CI (-0.86, -0.02), p = 0.06, I-2 = 81.64%]), the level of lipid metabolism (total cholesterol [SMD = -0.70, 95% CI (-1.01, -0.39), p < 0.001, I-2 = 86.74%] and triglyceride [SMD = -0.61, 95% CI (-0.87,-0.36), p < 0.001, I-2 = 80.64%]), inflammatory factors (Hs-CRP [SMD = -1.00, 95% CI (-1.54, -0.46), p < 0.001, I-2 = 86.81%], IL-18 [SMD = -1.25, 95% CI (-1.58, -0.92), p < 0.001, I-2 = 0], and TNF-alpha [SMD = -1.28, 95% CI (-1.64, -0.91), p < 0.001, I-2 = 75.73%]), and indicators of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde [SMD = -0.88, 95% CI (-1.22, -0.54), p < 0.001, I-2 = 66.01%] and advanced oxidation protein products [SMD = -0.92, 95% CI (-1.85, 0.00), p < 0.001, I-2 = 90.68%]). In terms of improving uric acid [SMD = -1.59, 95% CI (-3.45, 0.27), p = 0.09, I-2 = 94.67%], 2hPG [SMD = -0.04, 95% CI (-0.61, 0.53), p = 0.89, I-2 = 84.33%], HDL-C [SMD = 0.71, 95% CI (0.02, 1.40), p = 0.04, I-2 = 87.43%], Hb [SMD = 0.11, 95% CI (-0.10, 0.32), p = 0.32, I (2) = 0.00]), and superoxide dismutase [SMD = 1.32, 95% CI (0.44, 2.20), p < 0.001, I-2 = 93.48%], the effect is not obvious. Adjuvant treatment with NDQG did not increase the incidence of adverse reactions in the control group [SMD = 0.98, 95% CI (0.71, 1.34), p = 0.89, I-2 = 1.59%]. Obvious publication bias was detected by funnel plot and Egger's test. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis showed that adjuvant treatment with NDQG has more advantages than conventional treatment alone in the DKD treatment, which could improve clinical efficiency, kidney function, the level of glucose metabolism, the level of lipid metabolism, inflammatory factors, and oxidative stress indicators. At the same time, it also showed that NDQG are relatively safe. However, more high-quality studies are needed to provide more reliable evidence for clinical use.

Methods We conducted a meta-analysis of the published literature (2011-2021) using 148 pairwise comparisons between crop productivity after additions of BBF, of conventional fertilizers (fertilized control), and a non-fertilized control. Results On average, BBF applied at very low application rates (mean of 0.9 t ha(-1)) increased crop productivity by 10% compared with fertilized controls and 186% compared with non-fertilized controls. This mean crop productivity increase is comparable to that reported when biochar is used as a soil conditioner (i.e., 15 t-30 t ha(-1) to increase crop productivity by 10%). This crop yield increase suggests that biochar acts as a matrix to increase fertilizer use efficiency to a larger extent than conventional fertilizer alone. Cluster analysis revealed that BBFs have the potential to increase crop productivity by 15% when added to soils that are not responsive to conventional fertilizers. BBF produced at a highest heating temperature (HHT) of >400 degrees C increased crop productivity by 12% as opposed to those produced at a HHT of <= 400 degrees C that showed no increase. BBF with C contents >30% in the final mixture caused the largest increase in crop productivity by 17%, whereas those with C contents <= 30% had no effect. Conclusion This study has shown that biochar can be an effective constituent of novel fertilizers with enhanced efficiency, which may contribute to lower nutrient losses and lower negative environmental impacts.

CeO2 showed high catalytic activity for the production of N,N '-dibutylurea through n-butyl amine and CO2. Herein, V-doped CeO2 with different molar ratios of V/Ce (V-x%-CeO2, x = 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0) were further successfully synthesized and firstly applied to the reaction of CO2 with n-butyl amine. The reaction results displayed the catalytic performance of CeO2 were prominently enhanced by doping V5+ and followed an order of V-0.8%-CeO2 > V-0.6%-CeO2 > V-1.0%-CeO2 > V-0.4%-CeO2 > CeO2. The reason for the changes in the catalytic activities of CeO2 with different doping amounts of V5+ could be closely related to the surface oxygen vacancy and surface weak acidity and weak basicity based on specific analysis of relevant characterization including XRD, BET, Raman, XPS, EPR and NH3/CO2-TPD.																			1011-372X	1572-879X				DEC	2024	154	12					6425	6434		10.1007/s10562-024-04806-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10562-024-04806-8		SEP 2024											WOS:001312677400002

However, its relatively poor performance and conductivity limit its commercial applications. Here, we highlight a unique ion irradiation method to enhance the catalytic activity of NiO. Benefiting from sulfate anchoring and the introduction of oxygen vacancies by He+ ion irradiation, the optimal catalyst (ir-S-NiO) exhibits an outstanding OER performance with a low overpotential of 269 mV at 10 mA cm-2. Moreover, the fabricated Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) constructed by the ir-S-NiO is demonstrated to need a cell voltage of 1.72 V to reach a current density of 0.1 A cm-2 and shows remarkably long-term stability for 200 h without obvious attenuation at the current density of 0.5 A cm-2. This work provides a new method for the development of high-performance and stable OER electrocatalysts.

Within the scope of this study, a 2-month-old male (150-200 g) 70 Wistar Albino rat was used and a total of seven groups were designed. The first group (CNT) was maintained for control purposes. The second group (COL-1) was given COL for 1 day, at a dose of 500 mg/kg at 6-h intervals, and blood and tissue sampling was performed at 24 h. The third group (COL-7) received COL for 7 days, at a dose of 500 mg/kg at 6-h intervals on day 1 and at a daily dose of 500 mg/kg on the following days, and blood and tissue samples were taken at the end of seventh day. The fourth group (PAR-1) was administered with PAR at a dose of 1.0 g/kg bw and was blood and tissue sampled at 24 h. The fifth group (PAR-7) received PAR at a dose of 1.0 g/kg bw on day 1 and was blood and tissue was removed at the end of day 7. The sixth group (PAR+COL-1) was administered with a combination of PAR (1 g/kg bw) and COL (500 mg/kg at 6-h intervals), and blood and tissue samples were collected at 24 h. The seventh group (PAR+COL-7) received 1.0 g/kg bw of PAR on day 1 and was given COL throughout the 7-day study period (at a dose of 500 mg/kg at 6-h intervals on day 1 and at a daily dose of 500 mg/kg on the following days). In the seventh group, blood and tissue samples were taken at the end of seventh day. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glucose, creatinine, triglyceride, total bilirubin, total protein and albumin levels/activities were analysed in the serum samples. The malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels/activities, known as oxidative stress parameters, were assayed for tissue homogenates and blood (erythrocytes/plasma); in addition, enzyme activities of GSH S-transferase (GST), cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1), NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (CYTB5), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), NADPH-cytochrome P450 C reductase (CYTC) and glutathione (GSH) levels/activities defined as drug metabolising parameters were measured in liver homogenates. In result, it was determined that PAR caused significant alterations in some biochemical and lipid peroxidation parameters and the activities/levels of drug metabolising parameters in the liver and that COL normalised some of these parameters and reduced PAR-induced tissue damage.

The introduction of Pd with minute mass loadings of 2.7-5.3 mu g cm(-2) enables a negative shift of onset potential of CHZ electrooxidation by 320 mV regardless of Ni supports. Pd in Ni@Pd-Ni NAs electrode can facilitate the chemical dissociation of CHZ into N2H4 and/or H-2 and then provoke the occurrence of side reactions, i. e., N2H4 and/or H-2 electrooxidation. The direct CHZ fuel cell made of Ni@Pd-Ni NAs anode delivers an open circuit voltage of 1.05 V and a peak power density of 22.90 mV cm(-2) at the operating temperature of 303 K.

Facile solid-state synthesis of Fe3O4/kaolinite nanocomposites for enhanced dye adsorption	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY												Synergistic metal oxide nanoparticles - kaolinite couplings have received much research attention as promising adsorbents because of their porous two-dimensional (2D) nanostructure and high adsorption ability. However, finding a simple method to prepare such a nanocomposite with high activity is still a big challenge. In this study, a novel and simple solid-state synthetic method of producing Fe3O4/kaolinite nanocomposites was developed for enhanced adsorptive removal of cationic (i.e., methylene blue, MB) and anionic (i.e., Congo red, CR) dyes. The obtained Fe3O4/kaolinite nanocomposites were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements. It was found that the amount of Fe3O4 nanoparticles formed in the kaolinite structure has a great influence on the properties and structure of Fe3O4/kaolinite nanocomposite. The sample containing 7 mass% Fe3O4 exhibited the best performance. The maximum adsorption capacity (mg g(-1)) increased from 13.4 to 42.3 for MB and from 14.3 to 138.5 for CR under neutral condition (i.e., pH: similar to 7.0), when the mass percentage of Fe3O4 in the nanocomposite was increased from 0 to 7, indicating that the dye-removal ability of kaolinite could be improved significantly by modification with moderate amount of Fe3O4. The adsorption of MB and CR could best be described by the pseudo-second-order equation, Langmuir adsorption model and Freundlich adsorption model.

Trametes hirsuta laccases (THL) extensively oxidized and polymerized lignosulfonates resulting in 62 and 54% decrease in phenolic groups from 52 g in samples incubated at pH 6 and 7, respectively, and as evidenced by the formation insoluble polymers at pH 6 and 7 in less than 2 h. Preliminary attempts to synthesize 100% lignosulfonate granules resulted in highly brittle randomly breaking particles with most particles <0.5 mm in diameter when dried. In order to produce bigger and regular sized lignosulfonate granules, 1% w/w alginate was incorporated into the polymerized lignosulfonates resulting in perfectly stable granules. Release studies showed that 100% lignosulfonate-based granules released all of the potassium nitrate and potassium phosphate in <5 days. However, in addition to helping make perfect granules, the incorporation of 1% alginate allowed the prolonged release of fertilizer over 25 days. This study therefore shows for the first time the possibility of synthesizing 100% biodegradable fertilizer delivery systems using 100% green technology "enzymes".

Nowadays, these compounds are typically produced through biotechnological processes, but electrochemical methods offer numerous advantages over alternative approaches. While studies have extensively explored metals like copper, palladium, gold, and platinum, nickel has received relatively limited attention in this context. Notably, nickel exhibits electrochemical activity suitable for organic electrosynthesis. This work has been achieved with 5-h long-term electrolysis, glucose as a reactant, utilizing modified nickel electrodes in a KOH solution. While these studies achieved substantial conversion rates, the selectivities and Faraday efficiencies toward gluconic acid and sorbitol remained comparatively low. The long-term electrolysis of glucose using modified nickel electrodes resulted in the identification of various side products. These include formic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, tartronic acid, glyceric acid, and arabinose.

When the concentration of LS-99/SDS/isobutyl alcohol is 0.1%, the expansion ratio can be 52.54 times, 25% drainage time is 210s. Coal spontaneous combustion processes shift toward the high temperature region under the action of foam. The maximum mass loss velocity is reduced. Activation energy analysis shows that the composite inhibition rate of air foam is 64.56%, and nitrogen foam has a 28.18% increase compared to air foam. The heat release decreases under the action of air foam. The coal sample exhibits a heat absorption process in the presence of nitrogen foam. In addition, the mechanism of foam inhibition of coal spontaneous combustion was analyzed from physical and chemical perspectives. In summary, nitrogen foam is more effective than air foam in extinguishing spontaneous coal combustion processes.

All the catalysts showed good performance even with crude glycerol obtained from biodiesel production, achieving conversions greater than 90 % and selectivities above 80 % at 70 degrees C. The catalysts were evolved at 5 and 10 mol.%, and no noticeable effect on conversion and selectivity were observed due to the concentration increase.

The catalytic activities of the as-prepared porous electrodes for the electrooxidation of benzyl alcohol were investigated in NaOH aqueous solution. It was found that the Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet/Ni foam electrode exhibited a superior current density to the obtained Co(OH)(2) nanosheet/Ni foam electrode for the electrooxidation of benzyl alcohol, in which the Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet electrode required an extremely low potential of similar to 1.33 V vs. RHE to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). The results of the durability test revealed that it exhibited an outstanding stability for the electrooxidation of benzyl alcohol. Moreover, the electrooxidation of benzyl alcohol for the green synthesis of benzoic acid with the simultaneous generation of hydrogen could be easily implemented in a two-electrode configuration by using noble-metal-free catalysts. When benzyl alcohol was fully oxidized, the optimized selectivity of benzoic acid and the faradaic efficiency for the electrooxidation of BnOH could reach 96% and 95%, respectively.

J	Rezaee, S; Shahrokhian, S				Rezaee, Sharifeh; Shahrokhian, Saeed			Ruthenium/Ruthenium oxide hybrid nanoparticles anchored on hollow spherical Copper-Cobalt Nitride/Nitrogen doped carbon nanostructures to promote alkaline water splitting: Boosting catalytic performance via synergy between morphology engineering, electron transfer tuning and electronic behavior modulation	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE												Exploring bi-functional electrocatalysts with excellent activity, good durability, and cost-effectiveness for electrochemical hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) in the same electrolyte is a crit-ical step towards a sustainable hydrogen economy. Three main features such as high density of active sites, improved charge transfer, and optimized electronic configuration have positive effects on the elec-trocatalyst activity. In this context, understanding structure-composition-property relationships and catalyst activity is very important and highly desirable. Herein, for the first time, we present the design and fabrication of novel MOF-derived ultra-small Ru/RuO2 nanoparticles doped in copper/cobalt nitride (CuCoN) encapsulated in nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon framework (NC) (Ru/RuO2/CuCoN@NC). For the synthesize of this nanocomposite, firstly bimetallic Cu-Co/MOF hollow nanospheres are prepared via a facile emulsion-based interfacial reaction method and used as the template for Ru ion doping (Ru-doped Cu-Co/MOF). Then, Ru-doped Cu-Co/MOF precursor during the carbonization/nitridation/cooling process converted to the Ru/RuO2/CuCoN@NC nanocomposite. Benefiting from the desirable composi-tional and structural advantages of more exposed active sites, optimized electronic structure, and interfacial synergy effect, Ru/RuO2/CuCoN@NC hollow nanosphere electrocatalyst demonstrates striking catalytic performances under alkaline conditions with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpoten-tials of 41 mV for HER and 231 mV for OER, respectively. Moreover, as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, a two-electrode device needs a voltage of 1.51 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Comprehensive electrochemical studies show that the excellent electrocatalytic perfor-mance of the Ru/RuO2/CuCoN@NC hollow nanosphere could be attributed to the improved physical and chemical properties such as desirable compositional, catalysts uniform dispersion, structural advan-tages of more exposed active sites, optimized electronic structure, high electrical conductivity, and inter-facial synergy effect. This work paves a novel avenue for constructing robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

This practical and operationally-simple method enables the preparation of either N-aroylureas or imides in good to excellent yields without addition of transition metals. The choice of base plays a significant role in controlling the reactivity of the inequivalent carbonyl groups.

However, their influence on the stability of blackberry wine (BBW) has not been studied. In this study, the influence of iron, copper, chromium and nickel on the stability of BBW was analyzed. The influence of iron ions on BBW and its main pigment cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) was analyzed by comparing chromaticity, fluorescence, and component. The mechanism by which iron ions cause C3G discoloration was further studied. After 15 days of aging, the stability of BBW added with 1 mmol/L copper, chromium, and nickel powder showed no significant change. However, BBW changed in color from red to blue after adding the same concentration of iron powder. This result could be attributed to the interaction with iron ions after a part of C3G was converted into delphinidin 3-O-glucoside (D3G). The higher hue of blue was obtained when the molar concentration ratio of iron ion to D3G was 4:1. This study was the first to observe and analyze the iron-induced color change in BBW. The research results provide a theoretical basis for guiding the wine brewers to avoid the color change of blackberry wine by controlling the source and concentration of iron ions in the brewing process.

While these alloys are corrosion resistant, under severe conditions corrosion can still occur, which can result in serious damage to a system in operation. To improve their reliability, the composition of nickel-based alloys can be tailored to particular operating conditions. To improve their corrosion resistance, alloying elements such as chromium, molybdenum (+tungsten), and copper can be added, which promote the oxide formation process and thereby contribute to oxide passivity.

Monitoring and controlling the level of toxicity in food for daily life is an important one. Hence, rapid and inexpensive detection methods are developed for the quantification of toxic chemicals. As a consequence, we have chosen the electrochemical sensing method for the detection of food toxicant diphenylamine (DPA). Herein, the flake-like structured nickel phosphate (NPO) is synthesized using the coprecipitation method and the preparation of NPO integrated graphene oxide (GO) by sonochemical treatment. As observed from electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) analysis, the NPO/GO modified screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) has a lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 624 ohm and a fast electron transfer rate. The higher catalytic activity of NPO combined with a higher conductive and active surface area of GO through the electrostatic interaction is applied for the electrochemical determination of DPA. Using the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique, the constructed NPO/GO/SPCE has a broad linear range (0.4 -680.8 mu M), low LOD (12 nM), and good sensitivity (1.01 mu A mu M-1 cm-2) towards DPA sensing. Furthermore, the resultant sensor revealed good selectivity, cyclic and storage stability, repeatability, and reproducibility. The practical application of the DPA was estimated in food samples such as apple, grapes, and orange juice with satisfactory recovery.

In this regard, the designed experiments for optimization indicated that the ultrasonic wave (40 kHz) and mass of adsorbent (30 g/L) were significant in HCHO removal so that the combination of the adsorption under ultrasonic degradation resulted in approaching the eliminating efficiency of more than 99%. In this way, GC-MS analysis confirmed the CO2 production during HCHO degradation. Although the physisorption mechanism (-15.56 kJ/mol) limited the HCHO concentration (similar to 100 ppm) for removal, addition of ultrasonic irradiation significantly improved the process to eliminate 986 ppm of HCHO from the real petrochemical effluent. Moreover, the mechanisms of HCHO decomposition were scrutinized through theoretical studies (density functional theory (DFT)), as well as thermodynamic and kinetics theories. Correspondingly, as calculated from the DFT, the highest adsorption on cleavage plane (111) of the adsorbent was shown to be in complete agreement with its XRD analysis in which the main peak corresponds to the lattice plane (111).																			0301-4797	1095-8630				MAY 1	2021	285								112085	10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112085		FEB 2021						33581458					WOS:000632616600004

Despite these merits, dispersing hydrophilic CFs in a hydrophobic polymer matrix is challenging. To address this, an amphiphilic ammonium salt was employed as the dispersant for CFs in this study. The hydrophobic CFs were mixed with a healable polymer to produce CF-reinforced composites. As the thermosetting polymer was crosslinked with Diels-Alder (DA) adducts, it was mended and recycled via a retro DA reaction at 120 degrees C. Interestingly, the CF-reinforced polymer composites were mended and recycled as well. When 5 wt % of the hydrophobic CFs was added to the polymer, maximum tensile strength, elongation at break, Young's modulus, and toughness increased by 70%, 183%, 75%, and 420%, respectively. After recycling, the CF-reinforced composites still featured better mechanical properties than recycled polymer.																				2073-4360				JAN	2019	11	1							117	10.3390/polym11010117	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/polym11010117								30960101					WOS:000457202000117

Effect of pore generator on microstructure and resistivity of Sb2O3 and CuO doped SnO2 electrodes	JOURNAL OF POROUS MATERIALS												Sb(2)O(3)and CuO doped SnO(2)ceramic electrodes could be an alternative to the ones currently used ones in the electrooxidation process of water pollutants. The rise of electrode surface by introducing a porogen agent on the composition was analysed in order to increase the electrochemical active surface. For this reason, several substances were tested. Although the densification and total pore volume had similar values, the microstructures and the pore size distributions generated were strongly dependent on porogen nature. A total of five porogens were tested, but petroleum coke turned out to be the best option for these electrodes. It was found that the electrical resistivity depends on the nature of pore generator. Furthermore, its relation to the porosity can be modelled with Archie's or Pabst's equations.

The characterization demonstrated that Fe, Co and O doping could boost the specific surface area and modulate the electronic structure of g -C3N4. With addition of PS, the FCOCN2 exhibited the maximum TC removal efficiency of 90.1 % after 120 min reaction, and the kinetic constant was 2.67 times that of pure g-C3N4. Meanwhile, the removal ratio of total organic carbon and reaction stoichiometric efficiency of PS could reach to 68.6% and 5.2%, respectively. When the addition of catalyst and PS were 0.6 g/L and 10.5 mM, respectively, the lower pH and TC concentration, as well as higher temperature were conducive to degradation reaction with activation energy at 23.88 kJ.mol(-1). As indicated by work function, a lower internal electronic excitation energy barrier enhanced electron transfer, so the active species of & BULL;O-2(-), O-1(2), SO4 & BULL;-, SO5 (& BULL;-) and & BULL;OH could be favorably generated on over metal (II/III) redox shuttles, electron -rich O/N and electron-deficient C active sites. The quantitative structure -toxicity relationship prediction of intermediates and the acute toxicity experiment showed that the toxicity of water treated for 60 min to V. fischeri, E. coli and B. subtilis was significantly reduced. Moreover, after five consecutive degradation cycles, the removal efficiency of TC still remained at 72.7%. Besides, even in matrices of tap water, river water, municipal wastewater and medical wastewater, the elimination proportion of TC by FCOCN2/PS were 90.0%, 88.6%, 74.0% and 81.5%, respectively. Hence, the FCOCN2/PS system may be a promising alternative for highly effective treatment of antibiotic contained wastewater and environmental protection.

Sb-doped SnO2 (Sb-SnO2), Bi-doped SnO2 (Bi-SnO2), or Bi-doped TiO2 (Bi-TiO2) are coated onto a Ta-doped IrO2 (Ta-IrO2) electrode using identical fabrication procedures involving coating and annealing cycles. The resultant electrodes display porous morphologies with interparticle connections. Crystalline phases of Sb-associated oxides are not evident in Sb-SnO2, whereas distinct Bi2O3 phases are observed in Bi-SnO2 and Bi-TiO2 because the radius of Bi3+ is larger than those of the base metals. Sb-SnO2 exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity for the decomposition of phenol irrespective of the type of electrolyte, whereas the activity of Bi-SnO2 is always poor. The activity of Bi-TiO2 is poor in sulfate and perchlorate electrolytes; in contrast, it is remarkably enhanced and comparable to that of Sb-SnO2 in chloride electrolyte. Such chloride-specific activity of Bi-TiO2 is attributed to the effective generation of reactive chlorine species, whereas the generation of OH radicals is limited. On the other hand, Sb-SnO2 effectively catalyzes the generation of OH radicals, leading to mediated generation of reactive chlorine species. The decomposition of phenol is further examined in terms of reaction intermediates and CO2 production using Sb-SnO2 and Bi-TiO2 anodes in sulfate and chloride electrolytes. The electrocatalyst and electrolyte-dependent mechanism is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The nanocomposites have been synthesized via a sol-gel route, employing cerium (III) nitrate as the CeO2 precursor and selected surfactants to control the growth of the CeO2 nanoparticles, which occurs during the supercritical drying of the aerogels. Samples with different loading of the CeO2 dispersed phase, ranging from 5 to 15%, were obtained. The nanocomposites showed the morphological features typical of the SiO2 aerogels such as open mesoporosity with surface area values up to 430 m(2)center dot g(-1). TEM and XRD characterizations show that nanocrystals of the dispersed CeO2 nanophase grow within the aerogel already during the supercritical drying process, with particle sizes in the range of 3 to 5 nm. TEM in particular shows that the CeO2 nanoparticles are well-distributed within the aerogel matrix. We also demonstrate the stability of the nanocomposites under high temperature conditions, performing thermal treatments in air at 450 and 900 degrees C. Interestingly, the CeO2 nanoparticles undergo a very limited crystal growth, with sizes up to only 7 nm in the case of the sample subjected to a 900 degrees C treatment.

It is shown that intrinsic activities of both reactions decrease with the increasing catalyst loadings, and a more significant decreasing trend was observed in glycine electrooxidation when compared to benzyl alcohol electrooxidation. These phenomena may be explained by an increasing of mass loading induced a decrease of the catalyst surface conductivity, structure changes of Ni(OH)(2) from alpha-phase to beta-phase, and the intercalation of glycine molecules into nickel hydroxide interlayers.

Obtained data delivered a proof for the RC ion surface adsorption and its later electroreduction over the potential range characteristic for the UPD H. A favourable role of platinum-adsorbed resorcinol anions on the kinetics of the UPD H and HER processes is also discussed. The above was explained via the recorded capacitance and charge-transfer resistance parameters (the presence of resorcinol at 1.5 x 10(-3) M in 0.1 M NaOH caused significant reduction in the resistance parameter values by 3.9 and 2.6 times, correspondingly, for the UPD of H at 50 mV and the HER process, examined at -50 mV vs. RHE) along with the charge transients, produced by injecting small amounts of RC-based 0.1 M NaOH solution to initially RC-free base electrolyte on the Pt(511) electrode plane (a large cathodic charge-transient density of -90 mu C cm(-2) was recorded at the electrode potential of 50 mV).

A wide range of cathodic electrochemical reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction, electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, and electrochemical hydrogenation of organic compounds, are explored for the production of chemicals using electrolysis systems. However, the anodic reaction normally coupled in the system-the oxygen evolution reaction, is less economically profitable based on the high energy consumption of the reaction and less valuable oxygen produced. Moreover, the crossover of oxygen may be detrimental to electrolytic systems sensitive to oxidants. As such, discovering potential alternative anodic chemistry in electrolysis systems, which includes the upgrading of chemicals and degradation of pollutants, may reinvigorate the associated electrochemical industries. In this perspective, explorations in this field are discussed predicated on the electrocatalytic mechanism, and the design of catalysts and reactors, motivating further studies on the optimization of the whole system towards practical application. A repository of alternative anodic chemistry in lieu of oxygen evolution, from the production of value-added chemicals or degradation of pollutants, enables profitable electrolysis systems for the renewable energy-driven electrochemical industry.					liu, zhifang/KIJ-0501-2024														1754-5692	1754-5706				DEC 6	2023	16	12					5771	5791		10.1039/d3ee02767h	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d3ee02767h		OCT 2023											WOS:001090503100001

Synthesis of mesoporous nickel ferrite nanoparticles by use of citrate framework methodology and application for electrooxidation of glucose in alkaline media	MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL					19th Brazilian Meeting on Analytical Chemistry / 7th Iberoamerican Congress on Analytical Chemistry	SEP 16-19, 2018	Caldas Novas, BRAZIL	Brazilian Chem Soc, Anal Chem Div				Electrooxidation of glucose in alkaline media is a critical issue as a clean source for Fuel cell application. The using of noble metals as anodes obstructs the economic cost of the glucose fuel cells (GFC(s)). That is why the trend is towards the recent doped metal oxides designs as low-cost anodes electrocatalysts. Here, Nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) nanoparticles (NFNPs) were simply prepared by the formation of citrate framework followed by combustion and calcination as a promising anode for GFC(s) at high pH. The as-designed NFNPs were investigated in terms of FE-SEM, TEM, EDX, and XRD analyses. The crystallinity study confirms the formation of NiFe2O4 cubic spinel with a crystallite size of around 13.7 nm. The surface morphology has a sponge-like structure with an irregular shape of pores. The diameters of sponge are varying, and the average is around similar to 572 nm. The successful formation of a porous network can be related to the releasing of considerable amounts of gaseous products during the combustion process at 180 degrees C and calcination process at 400 degrees C. The synthesized NFNPs showed enhanced electrocatalytic characteristics at different glucose contents up to 60.0 mM. Besides the high produced current, the enhanced stability and charge transfer were observed for the application of NFNPs in GEO.

The characterization results revealed that the addition of cerium changed the acid-base properties of the catalyst and that the strong basic sites on the catalyst surface played an important role in the reaction. The Mg3Al0.9Ce0.1O catalyst showed the highest catalytic activity (ethylene carbonate yield 98.1%). Compared with pure Mg-Al oxide, the appropriate addition of Ce was conducive to improving the surface basicity and adsorbed oxygen content of the catalyst. Additionally, the reaction process of the formation of ethylene glycol hydroxyl group with the alkoxy anion formed by the catalyst attacking the carbonyl carbon of nucleophilic dimethyl carbonate to form an adsorption intermediate (HEMC) on the catalyst surface for further intramolecular rearrangement to form ethylene carbonate was confirmed by operando infrared spectroscopy. The reaction kinetics shows that the reaction conforms to the second-order kinetic equation, and the activation energy is 53.71 kJ.mol(-1). Catalytic stability in a fixed-bed reactor was studied. After a long cycle of use (150 h), the yield of ethylene carbonate was stabilized at about 89.0%.

The treatment was performed under fast microwave irradiation and followed by mechanical homogenization, resulting in HCNFs with considerable amounts of xylan hemicellulose (15 % 19 %) remained. Less HAc consumption was achieved, which is beneficial for fabricating nanofibrils with higher aspect ratios (>800). More xylan contents and higher degrees of acetylation on cellulose were investigated, resulting in greater charge repulsion and steric hindrance between HCNFs and favoring the fibrils dissociation. Moreover, the HCNFs maintained high crystallinity of 70 % 80 % and good thermal stability, confirming the intact hydrogen bonding linkages between cellulose and xylan hemicellulose. Transparent films prepared from the HCNFs suspensions by vacuum drying approach displayed better mechanical strength (>40 MPa) and well-mimicked the complex of polysaccharides interactions in plant cell walls.

Towards the development of flexible carbon nanotube-parafilm nanocomposites and their application as bioelectrodes	RSC ADVANCES												Soft, flexible and conductive interfaces, which can be used as electrode materials integrated with commercial electronic components and the human body for continuous monitoring of different analytes are in high demand in wearable electronics. In the present work, we explore the development of a functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubeO-parafilm nanocomposite (f-MWCNT-PF) for the fabrication of a flexible electrochemical platform for glucose detection. The f-MWCNT-PF nanocomposite was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical techniques. A bioelectrode fabricated by immobilization of glucose oxidase at the f-MWCNT-PF surface was further characterized by atomic force microscopy and tested for glucose. The bioelectrode provides two linear regions of glucose detection: a linear range from 0.08 mM to 3 mM, with a correlation coefficient of 0.982 and a sensitivity of 35.322 mu A mM(-1); and a linear range from 5 mM to 25 mM, with a correlation coefficient of 0.964 and a sensitivity of 9.346 mu A mM(-1). The proposed method was successfully applied to measure glucose in blood serum samples, differentiating healthy and diabetic persons. Additionally, the lower detection region could be effectively applicable for glucose sensing in sweat or interstitial fluid samples. The flexible, water-repellant sensing platform can be used as a universal platform for analyte detection, demanding waterproof, conductive platforms for biosensing applications, as it is suitable for protein/enzyme immobilization.

In this study, the effect of 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([BMIM][Br]) and 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium methyl sulfate ([BMIM] [MeSO4]) ionic liquids on the structure and function of Chloroperoxidase (CPO) is investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The results confirm that low and high concentrations of the liquids alter the enzyme structure. At low concentrations of the ionic liquids, the enzyme active site is maintained, or even, it is facilitated the substrate access to the site. Whereas, the high concentrations of the ionic liquids open the enzyme structure and reduce the flexibility of its residues. The high concentrations of the liquids also enhance the order of water molecules. Accurately, [BMIM][MeSO4] possesses greater influence on the enzyme structure, because of the special structure of the corresponding anion group. Besides, the number of cavities interprets the activation of the enzyme at the low concentrations and its inactivation at the high concentrations. The penetration of the anions into the enzyme structure is confirmed at the high concentrations of the ionic liquids. The role of ionic liquids at low concentrations is related to their binding to the enzyme structure. Their role at the high concentrations depends on the changes in the solvent arrangement as well as the attachment to the enzyme. Some binding sites of the anions and cations of the liquids are introduced precisely. Studies have shown that in the presence of ionic liquid [BMIM][Br] a new channel has been created which facilitate access of both active site and "Hem" to the surface and could lead to higher enzyme activity and more efficiency. Therefore, low concentration of ionic liquid play an important role and cause higher chloroproxidase activity. Whereas in high concentration due to surface coating of chloroproxidase by ionic liquid, despite the access of the substrate to the active site, CPO activity decreases. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Here, the states of the CN-TiO2 photocatalyst were characterized by XPS, FT-IR and UV-vis spectroscopy as well as DFT calculations. The photo-electrochemical measurements confirmed that the enhancement of H-2 production is associated with effective charge separation under photo- excitation of highly dispersed carbon nitride on the TiO2 surface.

Here, we developed a simple Ni foam self-templating route for V-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays through in situ formation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) combined with subsequent conversion. The as-prepared MOF-V-Ni3S2/NF catalyst delivers outstanding electrocatalytic performance in the alkaline solution, which requires low overpotentials of 118.1 mV @10 mA cm(-2) and 268 mV @10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. The V-doping and MOF-derived 3D hieratical nano structure play a vital role in the catalytic process, which provides efficient active sites and large surface areas. Furthermore, an alkaline electrolyzer was assembled with two pieces of MOF-V-Ni3S2/NF, which achieves efficient water splitting at 1.58 V @10 mA cm(-2). This strategy opens up new channels to synthesize MOF-based bifunctional electrocatalysts toward overall water spitting. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

CNF were functionalized with negative (CNF-) and positive (CNF+) charges to improve (i) the CNF-nutrient and (ii) the CNF-polymeric matrix interactions. The CNF encapsulated the KNO3 nutrient by spray drying (microcapsules) and then inseroted into a poly (hydroxybutyrate)/starch-based matrix by melt-compounding (tablets). These materials were morphologically, structurally, and thermally characterized before and after biodegradation. Nutrient release profiles showed the microcapsules released the nutrients for up to 1 h, while the tablets did for 8 h in water and over 80 days in soil. Tablets with CNF released NO3 faster than K+, and those with CNF+ behaved inversely. Besides, the biodegradation efficiencies were up to 75 % in 120 days. The CNF charges affected nutrient release and the matrix biodegradation, ensuring the matrices were harmless to the environment.

Conversion of NO into N2 over γ-Mo2N	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C												Cubic molybdenum nitride (gamma-Mo2N) exhibits Pt-like catalytic behavior in many chemical applications, most notably as a potent catalyst for conversion of harmful NOx gases into N-2. Guided by experimental profiles from adsorption of (NO)-N-15 on gamma-(Mo2N)-N-14, we map out plausible mechanisms for the formation of the three isotopologues of dinitrogen (N-14(2), N-15(2), and (NN)-N-14-N-15) in addition to (NNO)-N-14-N-15. By deploying cluster models for the gamma-Mo2N(100) and gamma-Mo2N(111) surfaces, we demonstrate facile dissociative adsorption of NO on gamma-Mo2N surfaces. Surfaces of gamma-Mo2N clearly activate adsorbed (NO)-N-15 molecules, as evidenced by high binding energies and the noticeable elongation of the N-O bonds. (NO)-N-15 molecule dissociates through modest reaction barriers of 24.1 and 28.1 kcal/mol over gamma-Mo2N(100) and gamma-Mo2N(111) clusters; respectively. Dissociative adsorption of a second (NO)-N-15 molecule produces the experimentally observed Mo2OxNy phase. Over the 100 surface, subsequent uptake of (NO)-N-15 continues to occur until the dissociated O and N atoms occupy all 4-fold hollow and top sites. We find that, the direct desorption of N-15(2) from the Mo2OxNy-like phases phase requires a sizable energy barrier to precede. Considering a preoxygen surface covered cluster reduces this energy barrier only marginally. Desorption of N-15(2) molecules takes place upon combination of two adjacent N atoms from top sites via a low-energy multistep Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. Dissociative adsorption of gaseous (NO)-N-15 molecules at surface Mo-N bonds weakens the Mo-N bonds and leads to formation of (NN)-N-14-N-15 molecules (where N-14 denotes a nitrogen atom originated from surfaces of gamma-Mo2N crystals). Liberation of N-14(2) molecules occurs via surface diffusion of two surface N atoms on the (111) N-terminated surface. Formation of (NNO)-N-14-N-15 proceeds via direct abstraction of a surface N-14 atom by a gaseous (NO)-N-15 adduct.

J	Nie, SA; Zhao, LX; Lei, XM; Sarfraz, R; Xing, SH				Nie, San'an; Zhao, Lixia; Lei, Xiumei; Sarfraz, Rubab; Xing, Shihe			Dissolved organic nitrogen distribution in differently fertilized paddy soil profiles: Implications for its potential loss	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is recognized as an important nitrogen (N) pool in soil N cycling, but its role in the N cycling of paddy soils, which are intensively fertilized, is not fully predicted. In this study, we investigated DON in flooded layer and soil solution along soil profiles with suction cups in fertilized paddy fields. The DON concentration showed a relative decrease in the deeper layer of paddy soil, while free amino acid N (FAA-N) exhibited a drastic increase along with nutrient profiles of soil. In the upper layer (0-20 cm), DON accounted for 54-64% of total dissolved N (TDN), but this value increased up to 63-97% in the deeper layer (40-60 cm). Low concentrations (9.6-15.0 mu g L-1) of FAA-N and low percentage of FAA-N/DON (0.1-0.2%) were observed in the upper layer, but higher concentrations (111-307 mu g L-1) and increased percentage (8-36%) were examined in the deeper layer. The high percentage of DON/TDN indicated that DON was the predominant N pool in the deeper layer. Concentrations of DON were significantly and positively correlated with organic matter, total N, and electrical conductivity (EC), while negatively related to soil pH. Additionally, capillary porosity, air porosity, bulk density and particle density were also found to be significantly associated with DON. We suggest the DON and FAA in the paddy field could be an important source for N leaching, which is most strongly related with soil nutrient profiles and physical properties. It is estimated that a total loss of 4.0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) is potentially linked to DON in the paddy field, which implied that ca. 3.35% of the applied N fertilizers could be lost via DON.

Mixed-Metal Semiconductor Anodes for Electrochemical Water Splitting and Reactive Chlorine Species Generation: Implications for Electrochemical Wastewater Treatment	CATALYSTS												A procedure for the preparation of semiconductor anodes using mixed-metal oxides bound together and protected with a TiO2 nanoglue has been developed and tested in terms of the relative efficiencies of the oxygen evolution (OER), the reactive chlorine species evolution (RCS), and the hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions. The composition of the first anode is a Ti metal substrate coated with IrTaOx and overcoated with TiO2 (P-25) that was mixed with TiO2 nanogel, while the second anode consists of a Ti metal substrate coated with IrTaOx and an over-coating layer of La-doped sodium tantalate, NaTaO3: La. The experimental efficiencies for water splitting ranged from 62.4% to 67.5% for H-2 evolution and 40.6% to 60.0% for O-2 evolution. The corresponding over-potentials for the Ti/IrTa-TiO2 and Ti/IrTa-NaTaO3: La anodes coupled with stainless steel cathodes of the same dimensions were determined to be 437 mV and 367 mV for the OER, respectively, and 239 mV and 205 mV for RCS, respectively. The preparation procedure described herein should allow for easier production of large-surface area anodes at lower costs than standard methods.																			2073-4344					APR	2016	6	4							59	10.3390/catal6040059	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/catal6040059													WOS:000375210900011

In this work, cellulose was isolated from the waste of brown algae (BA) after alginate extraction and was demonstrated to be cellulose I with a weight-average molecular weight (M-w) of 2.69 x 10(5). The results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements indicated that BA cellulose existed as nanofibers in the BA. Subsequently, the BA cellulose was oxidized by NaCIO to obtain well-dispersed cellulose nanofibers in water. The results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that the average values of the width, length and aspect ratio of BA cellulose nanofibers were 4 nm, 1.1 mu m, and 275, respectively. The rheology behavior of the nanofiber suspension in water demonstrated its high viscosity and shear-thinning behavior. More importantly, the BA cellulose nanofibers exhibited superior thickening behavior in milk because the BA cellulose nanofibers absorb casein micelles through hydrogen bonds to form a weak gel-like structure. The MTT test confirmed the nanofibers' safety and good biocompatibility. The cellulose nanofibers derived from an abundant marine bioresource could be expected to have applications in the food industry. This work opened a new pathway to fabricate bioactive cellulose nanofibers with a high aspect ratio as a food thickener. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
